,Public Enemy,"(feat. Paris),(Malcolm X),Being here in America doesn't make you an American,Being born here in America doesn't make you an American,Why if birth made you an American you wouldn't need any legislation,You wouldn't need any amendments to the Constitution,I don't see any American dream, I see an American nightmare,I'm one of the 42 million black people who are the victims of America,(Paris),Aiyyo we all in together now, all in together now,Hard truth soldierin, hard truth soldier SHIT,Keep on servin 'em, cause you know we do work,Mashin in my Chevy down the streets of New York, they feel me,I smooth grip, and hit up the spot,Snatch Flav as my dual pipes burn up the block,We bumpin hardcore, heavyweight, b-boy blast,On the street they hear my beat, my 69 is fast,Smash down Lennox, head up to the 'View,Some reporter wanna holla and I said it was cool,Wanna know about the album and the Enemy's new,How P.E. and Guerilla Funk is keepin it movin,Breakin bread talkin politics, you know how it go,'Bout the war and how it's shitty that we murder for dough,Then the reporter asked a question, that I had to mash,How, I would act if every day was maybe my last,How if every day I worried 'bout my family in this,I'd be murdered on these street in a puddle of piss,Or if I would get some news that my brother had died,If they ran up in my house and held my kids and my wife,Or if we was looted and somebody took all our thangs,If my sister was abducted, never heard from again,I began to compare it, so he could observe,When I made the parallels with how they livin abroad,I can't ignore it, these pigs ride deep in the streets,Cap a nigga for his wallet, beat another for free,And the cold part about it, life is cheaper than that,Down there people on the bottom kill each other for scraps,Imagine that, propoganda got the people confused,Damned by the media that keep 'em subdued,I been around the world, seen a lot of shit in my life,Same sirens, same ghetto birds swirlin at night,Same racism, profilin each of us all,Same outsiders where we live enforcin the law,Gats clappin on the streets, gunplayin with heat,Same prisons full of brothers herded in like sheep,Same turncoats that'll burn folks for pay,Same conditions in communities we die everyday,Same brutality and ignorance, now what will it take,to break the motherfuckin cycle, get the people away?,That's why I'm fresh out of tears for 'em, all out of tears for 'em,Even though my heart goes out, what the fuck you cryin 'bout?,Money for rebuilding but, what about home?,When the way we live is shitty where's the love for our own?,I can't decide it, it's real, I hit you with proof,Maybe I'll be suicided cause I hit you with truth,See they kill for less than what we say on records to you,Hear the message in the music from a rebel to you, now listen,(Outro: repeat 6X to end),Save my life you gotta, save my life you gotta {*3X*},Save us, save us

Yo! Bum Rush the Show (1987),Public Enemy,"Step back, get away, give the brother some room,You got to turn me up when the beat goes boom,Lyric to lyric, line to line,Then you'll understand my reputation for rhyme,Cause my rhyme reputation depends on what,Style of record my DJ cuts,His slice, dice, super mix so nice,So bad, you won't dispute the price,It's plain to see, it's a strain to be,Number one in the public eye enemy,I'm wanted in 50, almost 51,States where the posse got me on the run,It's a big wonder why I haven't gone under,Dodgin' all types of microphone thunder,A fugitive missin' all types of hell,All this because I talk so well,When I,,Rock, get up, get down,Miuzi weighs a ton,The match up title, the expression of thrill,For elite to compete and attempt to get ill,If looks could kill, I'd chill until,The public catches on to my material,Ducks criticize my every phase of rapture,Can't wait to read the headlines of my capture,Accused of assault, a 1st degree crime,Cause I beat competitors with my rhymes,Tongue whipped, pushed, shoved and tripped,Coocked from the hold of my Kung Fu grip,And if you want my title, it would be suicidal,From my end, it would be homicidal,When I do work, you get destroyed,Make all the paranoid, try to avoid,The Public Enemy seat I've enjoyed,This is no kid and I'm no toy boy,Rock, get up, get down,Miuzi weighs a ton,I'm a Public Enemy but I don't rob banks,I don't shoot bullets and I don't shoot blanks,My style is supreme, number one is my rank,And I got more power than the New York Yanks,If miuzy wasn't heavy I'd probably fire it,I'd make you walk the plank if I was a pirate,If they made me a King, I would be a tyrant,If you want to get me, go ahead and try it,Snatcher, dispatcher, biter never been a,Instead of takin' me out, take a girl to dinner,The level of comp has never been thinner,It's a runaway race where I'm the winner,It's unreal, they call the law,And claimed I had started a war,It was war they wanted and war they got,But they wilted in the heat when miuzi got hot,Rock, get up, get down,Miuzi weighs a ton,My style versatile said without rhymes,Which is why they're after me on my back,Lookin' over my shoulder, seein' what I write,Hearin' what I say, they wonderin' why,Why they can't ever compete on my level,Superstar status is my domain,Understand my rhythm, my pattern of lecture,And then you'll know why I'm on the run,This change of events results in a switch,Lateral movements of my vocal pitch,It eliminates pressure on the haunted,But the posse is around so I got to front it,Plus employ tactics so coy,And leave no choise but to destroy,Soloists, groups and what they say,And all that try to cross my way
