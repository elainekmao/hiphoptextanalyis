Cypress Hill (1991),Cypress Hill,"'...Boulevard, (garbled) in the building next to the location. ,Suspects are seen climbing out of both windows. Male hispanic, ,and a possible male,black. They have their vehic' er van parked outside...',This pig harassed the whole neighborhood,Well this pig worked at the station,This pig he killed my Homeboy,So the fuckin' pig went on a vacation,This pig he is the chief,Got a brother pig Captain O'Malley,He's got a son that's a pig too,He's collectin' pay-offs from a dark alley,This pig is known as a Narco,If he's a pig or not, we know that he could be,This pig he's a fuckin' fag,So all his homepigs they call him a pussy,Well this pig he's really cool,So in this class we know he rides all alone,Well this pig's standin' eatin' donuts,While some motherfuckers out robbin' your home,This pig he's a big punk,And I know that he can't stand the sight of me,'Cause pigs don't like it when ya act smart,And when ya tell 'em that you're a group from society,This pig works for the mafia,Makin' some money off crack,But this little pig got caught,So when he gets to the Pen it's all about the pay-back,'Cause once he gets to the Pen,They won't provide the little pig with a bullet-proof vest,To protect him from some mad nigga,Who he shot in the chest and placed under arrest,An' it's all about breakin' off sausage,Do ya feel sorry for the poor little swine?,Niggas wanna do him in the ass,Just ta pay his ass back, so they're standin' in line,That fuckin' pig,Look what he got himself into,Now they're gonna make some pigs feet outta this little punk,Anybody like pork-chops?,How 'bout a ham sandwich?,How 'bout a ham sandwich?

They all fucked up now ,Cuz they let a nigga back on the street some how ,I'm looking for some one like me ,Living in my own world to my own degree ,On the loose in the city looking at the ho with the titties ,Looking at me and I feel shitty ,A lil tensed up getting hot ,Cuz she looks like my girl who got smoked at the crack spot ,I'm trying to find ways to cope ,But I ain't fuckin around with a gage or a rope. ,(Hook) ,I'm having illusions all this confusion's ,Driving me mad inside ,I'm having illusions all this confusion's ,Fuckin me up in the mind.

Slacker with a license to kill (uh-huh),I think you know what time it is, it's time to get real (yea),Now what do we have here?  A banger and his peers,(B-Real),He cuffed my hand you understand he threatened me with tears,Sorry motherfucker had his gun out with a grin,You think the story's over but it's ready to begin,(Chorus),(Sen Dog),Now I got your crack and most of your crew,You got a couple choices of what you can do,Better make the right decision if you know what I mean,You can do some time, or fork over your green,(B-Real),I said I got no green he started lookin at me harder,I said I don't have nothin you can go fuck your daughter (WHAT?),He hit me with the fist, he hit me with the gat,He put the night stick to my back, soooooooooooooo,I think I'm done, the pig's got my gun,It isn't lookin good, I got ink on my thumb,Another pig walked in, said he's playin games,He gave another look at me, found out my false name,(Chorus),(B-Real),Sittin there pissed as I dwell in my cell,The place smells like shit, in the County Jail,Homey lookin at me like he seen me before,He started throwin up a set, then he spit on the floor,I think ay-yeah yo, I know this kid,It's the same motherfucker cocktailed my crib,This dude said - get ready - pulled a shank on me,I said c'mon homey you a bit too sloppy,Fool tried to stab me, socked him in the eye,The guards yelled, ""Give it up!"" and let two fly,The guards said down and we hit the floor,If you make a move after you won't move no more,He said I think you once again best protect ya neck,I said eat a dick from me you don't get respect,I said you wanna come with it, any time and place,And I'll leave you like Pacino with a Scar-on-ya-face,They put him in the hole, and all the bullshit stopped,But when his boy had beef, yeah he got dropped,P.D. had no witness, D.A. dropped the load,I got probation for the gun and the dope, case closed,(Chorus) - 2X

She had glossy lips,,she was swaying her hips on the dance floor and every nigga's,flashing the grips trying to impress her in vain, ,she gave no play, Niggaz hit her up for numbers and she said no way.,I thought to myself let it go the girl on beat,,but like Smoky said she really had a hold on me. ,I couldn't stop staring I started to fantasize with her. ,Voices in my head said she's tantalizing ya. Even if I ,moved to the other side of the party I had pictures in my ,head of her moving that body. I was beside myself with conquer,pain so I slowly walked over and I asked her name,Chorus 2x:,What's your name? What's your number?,I would like to get to know you,,Can we have a conversation? ,The night is young, Girl ,Give me a chance,She gave a smile but I got no answer though it took a while ,before she could gave a chance she sat too cool. I offered her ,a drink she turned me down flat she said If you want my name ,you gotta do better than that. I said, Okay, now your shit ,don't stink, I'ma walk away, only tried to buy you a drink. ,As I began to walk away she said I'm sorry for reals, but every ,guy in the club tries slipping me pills, I don't trust that each ,and everyone would lie to you I said I understand but that's ,not what I tried to do, I wasn't even gonna go to your table but ,if I didn't, I knew that I'd regret it later. I go after what I ,want but I got class. For me no need to slip a pill if I want. ,She gave me a funny look, I couldn't tell what it meant. She let,her guard down and on the conversation went,Chorus 2x:,What's your name? What's your number?,I would like to get to know you,,Can we have a conversation? ,The night is young, Girl ,Give me a chance,Lets go!,She said: I want a man with the plan and ambition, not an immature nigger,on a pussy-hit mission. I'm too good for that, I've got so much to offer.,Got a good job, working at my mom and dad's law firm. You got ,goals? that's what she asked, Yeah, I want to fill my home with ,platinum plaques. It takes hard work but you know it's coming ,after. She said Oh My God! You must be a famous rapper. I do ,alright, but I'm never satisfied. I'm told 'when you still love ,what you do it never gets old'. I strive for more but that's enough ,about me. Why don't we skip out the club, take a walk on the street? ,We slipped outta the club with no worries, seemed she wanted to get ,out in a hurry. We hung all night, and we lost our friends...'til ,they caught us banging in the back of a Benz.,Chorus 4x:,What's your name?
