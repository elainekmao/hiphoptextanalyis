Cypress Hill (1991),Cypress Hill,"'...Boulevard, (garbled) in the building next to the location. ,Suspects are seen climbing out of both windows. Male hispanic, ,and a possible male,black. They have their vehic' er van parked outside...',This pig harassed the whole neighborhood,Well this pig worked at the station,This pig he killed my Homeboy,So the fuckin' pig went on a vacation,This pig he is the chief,Got a brother pig Captain O'Malley,He's got a son that's a pig too,He's collectin' pay-offs from a dark alley,This pig is known as a Narco,If he's a pig or not, we know that he could be,This pig he's a fuckin' fag,So all his homepigs they call him a pussy,Well this pig he's really cool,So in this class we know he rides all alone,Well this pig's standin' eatin' donuts,While some motherfuckers out robbin' your home,This pig he's a big punk,And I know that he can't stand the sight of me,'Cause pigs don't like it when ya act smart,And when ya tell 'em that you're a group from society,This pig works for the mafia,Makin' some money off crack,But this little pig got caught,So when he gets to the Pen it's all about the pay-back,'Cause once he gets to the Pen,They won't provide the little pig with a bullet-proof vest,To protect him from some mad nigga,Who he shot in the chest and placed under arrest,An' it's all about breakin' off sausage,Do ya feel sorry for the poor little swine?,Niggas wanna do him in the ass,Just ta pay his ass back, so they're standin' in line,That fuckin' pig,Look what he got himself into,Now they're gonna make some pigs feet outta this little punk,Anybody like pork-chops?,How 'bout a ham sandwich?,How 'bout a ham sandwich?

They all fucked up now ,Cuz they let a nigga back on the street some how ,I'm looking for some one like me ,Living in my own world to my own degree ,On the loose in the city looking at the ho with the titties ,Looking at me and I feel shitty ,A lil tensed up getting hot ,Cuz she looks like my girl who got smoked at the crack spot ,I'm trying to find ways to cope ,But I ain't fuckin around with a gage or a rope. ,(Hook) ,I'm having illusions all this confusion's ,Driving me mad inside ,I'm having illusions all this confusion's ,Fuckin me up in the mind.

Till Death Do Us Part (2004),Cypress Hill,"(church bells gong),(Verse One: B-Real),As a kid, I was known, son of a thug,Snub-nosed .38 in the glove, who can relate with us?,Never had an easy life, shit's way out,Clips spray out, fools pay out or play out,Any scenario, been there, done that,Gone where some of y'all niggaz, couldn't come back,Been through the hottest parts of hell,Came back with a hard shell and, hard as nails,I went through it all, do it all, screw it all,Small you recall, the hard times as a juve-nile,Often misunderstood,Some joined the military, others just joined the hood,Street corner combat, part of the dark streets,Your heart beats pump when my slugs release,And there ain't no tellin, don't be the one yellin,These birds are deadly, they can shatter your melon,(Chorus 2X: B-Real),When the street wars jump off, there's only one thing to do,Grab your gat and squeeze one off,This ain't the life of the soft ones who run off,You got one shot to get you a knot,(Verse Two: B-Real),At the crossroads, sick of holdin the badlands,Where street wars, kick off quicker than Van Dam,Mistakes of mad man, I remember the old ways,The old days where fools clapped yo' {?},No quarter, you feel me?,Life expectancy's just a little bit shorter,G's gave the order, you carried 'em out,Quick fast, you the last nigga I'm worried about,Get that street lead, that was one step over the edge,Much closer to death, every step I kept on,Learnin about the dark paths, made a hard left,Prayed to God death is swift and painless,This life ain't for everyone, stay out my shoes,You can't trade your fate, I hate to break the news,The young won't respect the fences these days,You a marked man if you get caught up in these ways,(Chorus),When the street wars jump off, there's only one thing to do,Grab your gat and squeeze one off,This ain't the life of the soft ones who run off,You got one shot to get you a knot,(pause for spooky instrumental),(Chorus),When the street wars jump off, there's only one thing to do,Grab your gat and squeeze one off,This ain't the life of the soft ones who run off,You got one shot to get you a knot

She had glossy lips,,she was swaying her hips on the dance floor and every nigga's,flashing the grips trying to impress her in vain, ,she gave no play, Niggaz hit her up for numbers and she said no way.,I thought to myself let it go the girl on beat,,but like Smoky said she really had a hold on me. ,I couldn't stop staring I started to fantasize with her. ,Voices in my head said she's tantalizing ya.

What's your number?,I would like to get to know you,,Can we have a conversation? ,The night is young, Girl ,Give me a chance,She gave a smile but I got no answer though it took a while ,before she could gave a chance she sat too cool. I offered her ,a drink she turned me down flat she said If you want my name ,you gotta do better than that. I said, Okay, now your shit ,don't stink, I'ma walk away, only tried to buy you a drink. ,As I began to walk away she said I'm sorry for reals, but every ,guy in the club tries slipping me pills, I don't trust that each ,and everyone would lie to you I said I understand but that's ,not what I tried to do, I wasn't even gonna go to your table but ,if I didn't, I knew that I'd regret it later. I go after what I ,want but I got class. For me no need to slip a pill if I want. ,She gave me a funny look, I couldn't tell what it meant. She let,her guard down and on the conversation went,Chorus 2x:,What's your name? What's your number?,I would like to get to know you,,Can we have a conversation? ,The night is young, Girl ,Give me a chance,Lets go!,She said: I want a man with the plan and ambition, not an immature nigger,on a pussy-hit mission. I'm too good for that, I've got so much to offer.,Got a good job, working at my mom and dad's law firm. You got ,goals? that's what she asked, Yeah, I want to fill my home with ,platinum plaques.

I'm told 'when you still love ,what you do it never gets old'. I strive for more but that's enough ,about me. Why don't we skip out the club, take a walk on the street? ,We slipped outta the club with no worries, seemed she wanted to get ,out in a hurry.
