Uhh, DMX nigga,Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh,I see ghosts clearly; even though, most don't hear me,They still wanna get near me - fear me, so I'm leery,Kinda eerie what I'm feelin - from the floor, to the ceilin,Straight through the roof, want the truth?,I kinda miss robbin and stealin,cause it kept a nigga hungry, only eatin when I starved,I was ugly, so I robbed, no one loved me, shit was hard,Went to God once in a while when it got a little too hectic,He was the only one I knew that I respected (WHY?),Didn't know why, didn't know what I was livin was a lie,If I ain't shit then, why should I try,See, plenty niggaz die, over dumb shit, up in the hood,Real good heart, but up to no good,Thought I did what I could, but I guess it, wasn't enough,The Devil told me it would happen but I kept callin his bluff,When it rains it pours now, my pains are yours,as yours are what's mine, define, revolvin doors (nigga!),Chorus: Busta Rhymes,(Why?) All my niggaz tell me (why) tell me (we die),Cause we crazy with it, quick to blaze you with it,From in my soul to every word that I curse,with all the agony expressed in this verse;,let me ask my niggaz (why?),My niggaz tell me (why) tell me (we die),Because we Gods nigga (and) we go the yard nigga,Because I walk the ground under my feet,and keep it live and stay in tune with the street,Now let me ask my niggaz (why?),(Jay-Z),They say the good die young, in the hood where I'm from,I only got one question to that - why the fuck am I here?,I look to the air, I ask God, ""Love me please,"",but in reality, only people that hug me is thieves,Same niggaz that send shots through my rugby sleeves,They wanna, slug me and leave, I'm thinkin it must be me,Please shed light, the hood's dark,I did my dirt but got a good heart,Shouldn't that count for somethin?,I was told I'd amount to nothin, most of my childhood,Liked by folks it was stuntin my growth,Seperated me from the shit I was wantin the most,Felt myself comin close to pumpin them O's,Lump in my throat, chest poked out, face was poker,Tryin to, erase my ghostes, chase the smokers,Got demons on both shoulders, ,tryin to chauffeur my life through the streets,In other words nigga my will was weak,Please feel what I speak, ,this ain't your average ordinary jargon,weak rap niggaz be talkin,This shit is deep, from the mind of Busta, 'X and me,To all my fallen soldiers, rest in peace, til we meet niggaz,Chorus w/ minor variations,(Busta Rhymes),I must be cuckoo, like I respect the new-you, never,See you too could get it through your FUBU sweater,like a nigga when he walk in the dark, trespassin,on a nigga land, shots echo loud in the park,I live and die for all the shit I believe,And rep for everything I stand for ,with every single breath I breathe,Like the intake from cigarette smoke, it's like you inhale,the demon in the gutter stressed struggled and broke,If the shit was all over tomorrow, I'd leave a treasure,for my kids with a legacy for my CHILDREN to follow,You know it's funny how the good die first,Get the peppin in your steppin faggot nigga,cause you could die worse,Hold on, you know I cut off my arm, in the name of reppin,REAL NIGGAZ in the midst of droppin this bomb,Allah blessin me to rep for the better, and carry on,somethin great and keep a nigga name livin forever!,Chorus w/ minor variations

Yeah, I simply got to thanks,But yo that was cool cause I kept striving,To go to high school and I kept climbing,A man with a shock from five ten,Gave me promises and dreams, said the contracts would end,For years sweating tears and frustration,Walking and talking, 360 rotations,Oh yeah, Lying Brian, where is your record?,The girls are coming up in a matter of seconds,Ahh!

But I'm sayin',Even though we probably link up every now and then,With minimal convo, look it's really good to see you, friend,Somethin' I realize that I don't even have to mention,Is whether or not you got me, that's somethin' that I never question,Sometimes I feel the people I love don't appreciate me,And some I hate to see the shit I've been goin' through lately,See you was here, when the shit started to haywire,You're still here, walkin' with me goin' through the fire,And I really love you for it, I know you all relate to,On everything that I believe and I appreciate you,And just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name,The way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same,Sometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearin' me out,But I thank you for just bein' there and for hearin' me out,I got a clearer view,I thank God that you've been there for me, I'm here for you,I made a decision despite all the things that we go through,I'm gonna take my time with you and be a friend indeed,I made a decision that everything's gonna be alright,Gonna stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed,Oh, I made a decision,I look in your eye and I see the pain in it,Life's a game, huh, maybe the game did it,I know I changed, they say that fame did it,Life is changed, huh, maybe the game did it,Two friends, now in two different places,And I'm Mr.Catchin' Planes and you catchin' cases,Friendship, we never based it on position,No matter the game, we both shared the same vision,Decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us,I would come to town and never get up with you,Around then things weren't so simple,I had my own issues that I was tryin' to get through,Outside chatter, messin' with our mental,On the chase for funds to trusts, you can't forget too,It's the real friends that you got to tend to,No matter how far, you'll just know that I'm with you,I made a decision despite all the things that we go through,I'm gonna take my time with you and be a friend indeed,I made a decision that everything's gonna be alright,Gonna stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed,I made a decision, yeah, yeah,I made a decision

straight lifted a nigga,How we moved his organs with kickback, shifted a nigga,Wild shots fire, everybody scatter like rats,Leavin nothing but gunpowder and a trail of smoke in these gats,Now we got this faggot nigga blood on our hands,But f**k it, determined to fulfill the best of these plans,Shit was hot but we was nowhere near ready to fall,My son said he shot, but he wasn't bleeding at all,Word, I started buggin when my nigga said he feel cold,Then I looked up on the right side of his shirt and found a little hole,So as we continue to radically blaze the fifth,Flame the iron, not giving a f**k, y'all niggas wanna rip?,Well we deaded three out of the four niggas who tried to jook,One nigga slid and think he got off the hook,Now let me find out one out of them three niggas we bodied,Was one of them Guyanese niggas who buy drinks up for the party,He was the nigga to flood the table with champagnes,Stupid motherf**ker tried to front, we had to leak his brain,Suddenly my nigga fell to the floor,And said his legs feel like them shits aint got no feelins no more,More the actin up the more the shit I felt in my gut,The shit was all over as soon as the director said CUT!,That's a wrap, good actin motherf**kers, good actin,That's the shit I'm talkin about,Y'all ready to watch the playback?,F**k around, that shit'll be a box office smash motherf**kers

Sometimes I smoke a cigarette and then I think and I choke on,how niggaz steal this funny style and I was struggling broke,Even though it don't surprise me, shit it's still kinda funny,When I ain't have, a nigga still would come and try to take from me,Instead of cutting my losses, being smart and just end shit,Niggaz was trying to be loyal, just to maintain a friendship,In the wrong situation, plus there's always a sequel,I'm with the wrong muhfuckers, plus they 'pose to be people's,As I get more money, days get colder,I learned to realize that power only lies in the hands of the beholder,So then I start the heart-on-my-heart as I walk like a soldier,Moving so militant, you think I had a chip on my shoulder,Living by morals and principles mainly,Having heavy thoughts to a kill a brother every time a fucker betrayed me,But now I'm winning with the strength of the nation,I promise that they not even foreseeing the size of the shit they'll be facing,I'm Aftermath now, shit's getting worse,Now when those same ""friends"" see me goin hard that shit be making 'em hurt,[Chorus],[Busta Rhymes],Instead they getting together with me so we both can get rich,When I'm outta town, these niggaz busy tryna fuck with my bitch,Same niggaz spend they money 'til the shit'll diminish,I hit 'em off and turn around and come right back when it finish,I said I'm tired of these niggaz, that'll owe me so much shit,that they can't pay me back for, fuck all the dumb shit,Sometime we can't forgive whatever balances off,'Specially when niggaz cross the line that niggaz never should cross,Realized and thus I state the same shit, get the Range,The more money niggaz get, shit around you will change,Even though niggaz'll flip and say, ""He the one changed"",Fuck you, the dude'll just'll justify.. takin his shit from you,The more money I get, I get more dangerous stupid,'Cause I been broke before, and I refuse to go back to it,And while I sweep these niggaz up under the rug with a broom,If I never see these ""friends"" again, that shit'll be too soon,Shit is real like every wind in my breath,And that's on everything I love, BLOOD OF MY BLOOD! FLESH OF MY FLESH!,[Chorus]

E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event): The Final World Front (1998),Busta Rhymes,"""Daddy, what's it going to be like in the year 2000?"",Well, sweetheart, for your sake I hope it'll be all peaches and cream, but I'm afraid the endtime is near; the cataclysmic apacolypse refered to in the scriptures of every holy book known to mankind. It will be an era fraught with boundless greed and corruption, where global monatary systems disinigrate, leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of overcooked rice. The nations of the civilized world will collapse under the oppressive weight of parasitic political conspiricies which remove all hope and optimism from their once faithful citizins. ,Around the globe generations of polluters will be punished for their sins, unshielded by the ozone layer they have successfully depleted, left to bake in the searing naked rays of light. Wholesale assassinations serve to destabilize every remaining government, leaving the starving and wicked to fend for themselves. Bloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax-dodging corporations wreak havoc. Pissed off androids tired of being slaves to a godless and gutless system, where the rich get richer and the poor get fucked over and out, unleash total worldwide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust, annihilating the terrified masses, leaving in its torturous wake nothing but vicious cannibalistic mutated radiated horribly disfigured hoards of satanic killers, bent on revenge, but against whom? There are so few left alive. Starvation reigns supreme, forcing unlucky survivors to eat anything and anyone in their path.,Massive earthquakes crack the planets crust like a hollow eggshell, causing unending volcanic eruptions. The creatures of the seven seas, unable to escape to certain death upon land, boil in their liquid prison. Disease encircles the earth. Plagues of viruses with no known cause or cure laying waste to whatever draws breath.,And human kind, having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers, fall victim to merciless attack at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes who seek to conquer our charred remains. ,This is Extinction Level Event, the Final World Front, and there is only. One. Year. Left.,""Wow, that's cool! I can't hardly wait!"",You don't have to, because here it is.

Where it hurts,I'll leave you in a (?) straight up leaking in the back of a church,Let a ghosting crib and haunt you like a ghost in your home,Leaving you old and crippet like them ruins in Rome,Watch your body shrivel up and turn your asses to smoke,Fuck your flesh don't get yo blood sucked, the blood of ya foes,I be that nigga that'll torture your spouse,And leave a thousand body bags like truth.com in front of your house,(Busta),Got me bugging on a whole notha level,Tell me how the fuck a nigga really end up having beef with the devil,Shit bomb the whole effect the nigga had on my dreaming,Body reacting mentally, going to war with the demon,Semi-chaotic like the typical storm,So embellished in the dream a nigga felt it in the physical form,The dream got my nose runny and shit,Eyes watery, shorty watching my body twitch funny and shit,Giving shorty sleeping with me the creeps,She bugging off how a nigga just sweating and breathing so hard in his sleep,Determined to conquer this nigga so let it begin,Absolutely focused on killing the demon within,So now we fight in the name of my brethren,And every blow connect during the fight you can hear the thunder roll into heaven,,Ain't hell a deep breath of fresh air,The devil's presence blows a cold draft leaving a scent of death in the air,While my mind was reassembling now,Simultaneous wifey watching a nigga body trembling now,Couldn't conquer me so now the devil wanted me dead,Stabbing a nigga with the same bone he ripped from his head,Yo its funny how the devils'll test us,But if fully select, niggas bless with something some'll raggle with impressions,Til I'm dead I'm always battling through,You can't believe you cut my main vein that all my blood be traveling through,Somebody gotta die, settle the score,Because it's me or this nigga, I'm fighting to the death, I'm ready for WAR,(devil laughing fades)

Change your dungarees,Smoking trees, getting cottonmouth, wild munchies,Bowed down the block eating food at Luigi's,Constipated...too much extra cheese,Well anyway, while I was cooling down at Luigi's,I met some Siamese twins from overseas...Lebanese,Let's begin with the friends from New Orleans,They had a fifth friend.  She was straight Black-Portuguese,Pretty palm-olive-soaped skin, Aloe Vera-lese,She looked like the type of chick you only see in fantasies,The type of chick you would kill for to get between the knees,Yo.  I made time to chill with Miss Portuguese,Would you believe, the bitch tried to steal my fucking house keys,And rob me for my G's,Had to show this crazy broad, I mastered my Degrees and my Ph.D.s,Got your face on camera; motherfucker say cheese,You better get with your friends quick, before I start to squeeze,Getting caught up in that freaky gold-digger Jamborees,I caught that ill vibe, Tip (Word, Bust?)

We can't have that,I'll hold your hand Black,We can't wind up with scratch,I put my best foot forward, when I play in life,Cause this world as I live it, chill's like a double edged knife,In the jam we regulate, cause we organize,Logically thinking when along's enterprise,A lot of brothers from the ghetto got the gift of gab,Peace to the West Coast and the East, we's fam,Need I make mention that the crew we've got,Make things get hot, like the FoFo shot.  Blauw!,No we don't promote no guns, but don't turn that cheek,In the world that we live calmness is viewed as weak,So, we got to stay awake for all these lizards and snakes,Some of them come as friends; some of them come as Jakes,We decipher all the force and build rounds with our friends,Why's that?,So we can live right until time ends,Yo why's that?,I estimate, so we can get these ends,Yo true that?,Busta and Tip, you know we make minds bend  ,(I caught that ill vibe, Bust) Word, Tip?
