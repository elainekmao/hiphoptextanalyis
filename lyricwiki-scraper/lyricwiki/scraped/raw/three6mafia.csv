Live By Yo Rep (1995),Three 6 Mafia,"Chorus x3,Evertime I see you slippin',I go and reach for my mac 10,Victims of my devils playground,(koopsta knicca),Damn I'm about to bust a cap up in these tricks,Chris,I'm thinkin' deadly and I'm scopin' with that infarred,Kickin' it with the hardest click,Leavin' bodies rottin' up in them ditches,Man what's done if my tongue hits like a ton of brizicks,Koops not concerned,I let you burn and burn and burn,Everything in the prophecy has been demonically read,So I learned,Deep in the morgue,Lie corps in the quateras,They wanna face in a line of order,Can you place this shit,When you crawled up on the red man,You bounce set up in this bitch,Sittin' man and thinkin',Though my dreams I hear little kids screamin,Poor preachers I waited for hangin',Which got me like bored in the psycho ward like daily,The 6-6-6 mystery man,Is takin' me straight to insanity,Could it be a dimension of witches that bring out voices,That issue more tragedies,The seas of cries,Will soon be turning,Your fuckin' life over,Left the priest and island bleeding of four leaf clover,Then I crinkle enough of these slugs,? ? I'd rather be mugged to drink up a pint of his blood,Chorus x1

,Three 6 Mafia,"(Juicy J)(sample from ""Slob On My Knob""),Does it real good,Does it real good,(Chorus)(Mr. Bigg sample from ""Yeah I Rob"") x2,Now when I pull up at the club I'm lookin so clean,Se-se-seventy seven Cut Dog painted lime green,To-to-today I'm married and my wife don't play,If ya want-if you want me to treat you ugly bitch you gotta pay,(DJ Paul),Can it be Rolls that pull all these hoes,Or could it be my Cadillac wit 20-inch Vogues,Can it be my manison in Memphis jacuzzi,Or could it be my crib in Florida on the beach,Can it be the ten million records that I sold,Or can it be the first one that ever go gold,Whatever it be like y'all jaw cause I don't stop,Continuously to make a ho draws drop, yeah,(Juicy J),I used to always wonder why my girls have fits,When I walk up out the mall they be lookin at me pissed,Maybe just becuz I ball ridin eight or nine whips,And my name is Juicy J and I ain't payin no bitch,When I was broke as a joke they didn't wanna get wit me,Till I bought a Maybach now they all wanna lick me,Wit a Playboy mansion downtown in the city,And the hoes lined up like ninety centy pennies,(Chorus) x2,(Paul Wall),I got the candy drippin stains off the Range when I'm switchin lanes,I'm in the slab glass house swangin grippin grain,They tellin me I'm the mane stangin licks to make a gain,Livin life in the fast lane gettin money I can't complain,These boppers see me ridin swangin wanna taste the fame,But you gotta break that bread wit me baby I'm married to the game,I fell in love wit stackin change I'm addicted to countin cash,I ain't worried bout naan ho I ain't concerned wit naan ass,I'm bout that dollar get it right I'm not out here lookin for a wife,I'm out here on that top flight on the grind all day and night,I'm a baller I'm a pimp I'm a thug and I'm a hustler,If you want some of this lovin break bread girl you a customer,(Chorus) x2,(Crunchy Blac),See she's a freak ho let me tell you all a-bout it,I met her in the Valley and the valley ain't Cali,She tried to act shy but I knew she was bout it,Hotter than a summer day when it ain't cloudy,She say she want cheese but thats no doubt it,She just another ho I'mma hit then I'm out it,I'm just like Jody out the back door see,Hidin my face cause her old man know me,(Chorus) x4,(music to fade)
