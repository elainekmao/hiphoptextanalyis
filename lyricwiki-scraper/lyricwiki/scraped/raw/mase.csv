Yeah, yeah,Do Puff drive Mercedes? Yeah, yeah,Take hits from the 80's? Yeah, yeah,But do it sound so crazy? Yeah, yeah,Well me personally,It's nuthin' personal,I do what work for me,You do what work for you,And I dress with what I was blessed with,Never been arrested,For nuthin domestic,And I chill,They way you met me,With a jet ski,Attached to a SE,Smoke my Nestle,No mad rap,Ask Cat,Where my check be?,Problem with ya'll,I say it directly,Went from hard to sweeps,Started to eat,From no hoes at shows,To manaj in suites,Now I be the cat,That be hard to meet,Gettin' head from girls,That used to hardly speak,Come on,Chorus 5X
