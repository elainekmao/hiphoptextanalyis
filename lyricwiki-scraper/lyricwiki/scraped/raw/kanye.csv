My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010),Kanye West,"[Chorus: KiD CuDi],Ain't no question if I want it, I need it,I can feel it slowly drifting away from me,I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying,I will never ever let you live this down, down, down,Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it,I can feel it slowly dripping away from me,No more chances if you blow this, you bogus,I will never ever let you live this down, down, down,[Verse 1],Penitentiary chances, the devil dances,And eventually answers to the call of Autumn,All of them fallin' for the love of ballin',Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin,Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums,Based off the way we was branded,Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon,And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random,But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage,I need a happy ending and a new beginning,And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative,This the real world, homie, school finished,They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it,I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS,I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?,[KiD CuDi],Ain't no question if I want it, I need it,I can feel it slowly drifting away from me,I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying,I will never ever let you live this down, down, down,[Verse 2],Is hip hop, just a euphemism for a new religion,The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing,But this is more than just my road to redemption,Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention,As long as I'm in Polo's smilin' they think they got me,But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me,I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me,If a nigga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet,But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus,Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics,We make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish,Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick,I insisted to get up off a this dick,And these drugs, niggas can't resist it,Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted,If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it!,[Kid Cudi],Ain't no question if I want it, I need it,I can feel it slowly drifting away from me,I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying,I will never ever let you live this down, down, down,[Verse 3],I need more drinks and less lights,And that American Apparel girl in just tights,She told the director she tryna get in a school,He said ""take them glasses off and get in the pool"",It's been a while since I watched the tube,Cause like a Crip said: ""I got way too many blues for any more bad news"",I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today,They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday,And what's a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach,I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach,But God said I need a different approach,Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke,It's not funny anymore, try different jokes,Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o,Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it,Play strings for the dramatic,And end all of that wack shit,Act like I aint had a belt in two classes,I aint got it I'm going after whoever who has it,I'm coming after whoever who has it,You blowing up, that's good, fantastic,That y'all, its like that ya'll,I don't really give a fuck about it at all,Cause the same people that tried to blackball me,Forgot about 2 things, my black balls,[Chorus: KiD CuDi],Ain't no question if I want it, I need it,I can feel it slowly drifting away from me,I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying,I will never ever let you live this down, down, down,Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it,I can feel it slowly dripping away from me,No more chances if you blow this, you bogus,I will never ever let you live this down, down, down, ,[Verse 4: Raekwon],I know cops, hems is lifting lenses,Kid, Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes,Counting up, smoking, one cuff,Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it,Steam about a hundred and one L's,Kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson,Nigga hat game was special,It matched every black pair of Nikes,Throwing dice for decimals,The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head,Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead,Got made code red,Break up the black skunk,The black dutch, back of the old shed,If you can't live, you dying,You give or buy in,Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding,Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan,Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye,[Kid Cudi],Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it,I can feel it slowly drifting away from me,No more chances if you blow this, you bogus,I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010),Kanye West,"One hand in the air if you don't really care,Two hands in the air if you don't really care,It's like that sometimes I mean ridiculous,It's like that sometimes this shit ridiculous,One hand in the air if you don't really care,Middle finger in the air if you don't really care,It's like that sometimes, man ridiculous,Life can be sometimes ridiculous,I'm so appalled, Spalding ball,,Balding, Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all,Baby you're fired, your girlfriend hired,And if you don't mind I'm'a keep you on call,We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all,I got dogs that chew a fuckin' hole through the wall,But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers,And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers,Housekeeping, I mean got damn one time,Let it be a bad bitch sweeping,That know we get O's like Cheerios,That know because they seen us in the videos,That know, the day that you play me,Will be the same day MTV played videos,That was a little joke -- voila!,Praises due to the most high -- Allah,Praises due to the most fly -- Prada,Baby I'm magic -- ta da!,Address me as your highness,High as United, thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited,Niggas be writin' bullshit like they gotta work,Niggas is going through real shit, man they outta work,That's why another got damn dance track, gotta hurt,That's why I rather spit something that gotta perk,Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches,I mean this shit is, fucking ridiculous,Fucking ridiculous, I mean this shit is,Fucking ridiculous,Five star dishes, different exotic fishes,Man this shit is, fucking ridiculous,Fucking ridiculous,How should I begin this, I'm just so offended,How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?,I'm so appalled I might buy the mall,Just to show niggas how much more I have in store,I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause,All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers,Dark knight feeling, die and be a hero,Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain,I went from the favorite to the most hated,Or would you rather be underpaid or overrated?,Moral victories is for minor league coaches,And 'Ye already told you ""We Major"" you cockroaches,Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossa's,The Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused,I lost thirty mill so I spent another thirty,'Cuz unlike Hammer thirty million can't hurt me,Fucking insane, the fuck am I sayin'?,Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing,All these little bitches too big for their britches,Burning their little bridges, fucking ridiculous,Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches,I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous,Fucking ridiculous,I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous,Five star dishes, different exotic fishes,Man this shit is, fucking ridiculous,Fucking ridiculous,Success is what you make it, take it how it come,A half a mill in twenties like a billion where I'm from,An arrogant drug dealer the legend I've become,CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one,Blackjack I just pulled in aces,You looking at the king in his face,Everything I dream muthafuckers I'm watching it take shape,While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith,Range Rove leather roof, love war fuck a truce,Still move a bird like I'm in bed with mother goose,Them hoes coming in a bakers dozen,Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't,I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest,So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest,I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance,So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness,I speak the gospel, hostile,Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils,Paranoid mind I'm still under the watchful,Eye of the law, aspire for more,Them kilo's came we gave you Bobby Brown jaw,Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call,Flow similar to the legend of the falls,Spillin' I own you all, yeah,One hand in the air if you don't really care,Two hands in the air if you don't really care,It's like that sometimes I mean ridiculous,It's like that sometimes this shit ridiculous,One hand in the air if you don't really care,Middle finger in the air if you don't really care,It's like that sometimes, man ridiculous,Life can be sometimes ridiculous,I am so outrageous,,I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet,If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist,My phrases amazes the faces in places,The favorite, huh, my cup over runneth with hundreds,Dummy, dammit, not like for me to waste it,The new commandment, thou shall not hate kid,My movement is like the civil rights I'm Ralph David,Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks,I am nothing like them niggas baby those are marks,I met this girl on Valentine's Day fucked her in May,She found out about April so she chose to March,Damn another broken heart,I keep bitches by the twos nigga, Noah's Ark,I got a seven on me, I call my bro Lamar,Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart,G-A-T in the Pathfinder,'Cause you haters got PHDs,Y'all just some major haters and some math minors,Tiger Woods don't make me grab iron,Ay yo champagne wishes and thirty white bitches,You know this shit is fucking ridiculous,Fucking ridiculous,You know this shit is fucking ridiculous,Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress,You know that shit is fucking ridiculous,Fucking ridiculous,You know this shit is fucking ridiculous,Fucking ridiculous,Fucking ridiculous,Fucking ridiculous,One hand in the air if you don't really care,Two hands in the air if you don't really care,It's like that sometimes I mean ridiculous,It's like that sometimes this shit ridiculous,One hand in the air if you don't really care,Middle finger in the air if you don't really care,It's like that sometimes, man ridiculous,Life can be sometimes ridiculous

imitation ice,My music for your soul, inspiration for your life,Every dime made in his life more disastrous,Help my young n-ggas see my way through the bachelors,While my old b-tch went back to get her Masters,Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters,The truth hurts everytime it's revealed,What goes around comes around, this is lights ferris wheel,Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parrallel park,Kentucky derby on the grill,The fact that I'm free lets me know God is great,Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate,These rappers talk crowns but I'd rather talk fear,Villian like candyman, say my name and I'll appear,No weapon formed against me shall prosper,A kuna matata, feet up sipping java,Strolling up the totem poll, what's my only problem,Scrolling through my

new beginning,And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative,And sold your dreams, you don't know who did it,I treat the cash, the way the government treats aids,I won't be satisfied til all my n-ggas get it,I need more drinks and more lights,Hot American Apparal girl in just tights,She told the director she tryna get in a school,Told to take them glasses off and get in the pool,It's been a while since I watched the tube,Its like a crip said: ""I got way too many blues for any more bad news"",I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today,They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday,What's a black beetle anyway, a ...roach,I guess thats why they got me sitting in f-cking coach,But God said I need a different approach,Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke,It aint funny anymore try dipping jokes,Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o,Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I'm got it,Play strings for the dramatic,And end all of that wack shh,Act like I aint had a belt in two classes,I aint got it I'm going after whoever who has it,I'm coming after whoever who has it,You blowing up, that's good, fantastic,That y'all, its like that ya'll,I don't really give a f-ck about it at all,Cause the same people that tried to black ball me,Forgot about 2 things, my black balls,Uh, I let you into my diary to admire me,The making of this man, I let you see the higher me,The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy,I'm drawing from both sides, I'm Siamese,The tug of war opens the door, entrada,Rip me apart and see what's inside this pinata,And rolling kilos in gym(?) is one saga,One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold potter,Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women whom,Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom,And blossom, I swear this Vegas nights was awesome,But adios I blow my own dice before I toss 'em, loss 'em,Some other muthaf-ckers double crossed 'em,Tryna snatch my n-gga back I blew a small fortune,Russell with the work, we was like the four horsemen,Rick Flair with the flame, I'm muthf-cking Gorgeous, woah,As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smtih,Whiter than the coke brush that they paint me with,Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss,But the devil red, tires double tread,I'm posting parks up. that gets me double head,Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head,The bright lights blind look what the devil did,Yeah,[Kanye West],It's hip hop, this is euphemism for a new religion,The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing,This is more than just my road to redemption,Malcolm West had the whole nation standing to attention,As long as I'm in Polo's they think they got me,But they would try to crack me if they ever saw a black me,I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me,If a n-gga aint running shootin a jump shot running a track meet,But this pimp is, on the top of mount Olympus,Ready for the Worl's game, this is my Olympics,We make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish,Choke a southpark writer with a fishstick,And I assisted to get up offa this d-ck,And these drugs, fans cant resist it,Remember, remind of when

",Kanye West:Through The Wire
The College Dropout (2004),Kanye West,"[Intro: Jay-Z],[laughing],Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost,For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker,Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room,'Cause they don't fucking..,(I'd like to propose a toast),(I said toast motherfucker),[Chorus: Kanye],And I am (here's to the roc),And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them (here's to Rocafella),Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky (here's to the roc),This is the last call for alcohol, for the... (here's to Rocafella),So get your ass up off the wall,[Verse 1],The all around the world Digital Underground, Pac,The Rudloph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc,I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame,And come back next year with the whole fucking game,Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top,They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop,Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself,Rocafella's only niggaz that help,My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair,Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here,They say he bourgie, he big-headed,Won't you please stop talking about how my dick head is,Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds,I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas,It's funny how wasn't nobody interested,'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus,[Chorus],[Verse 2],Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir,Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir,Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest,But all they got left is this guy called West,Better take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def,Call him Kwa-lI or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z,I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh,It come out sweeter than old Sadie,Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards,Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards,And I was almost famous, now everybody loves Kanye,I'm almost Raymond',Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?,It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him,Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine,Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme,Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem,Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams,I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed,But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh,So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more,You niggaz wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more,You can't say shit to Kanye West no more,I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga,I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don,Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom,I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards,I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars,I went to the malls and I balled too hard,'Oh my god, is that a Black Card?',I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term,African American Express,Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell,Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to,Killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical shit,Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips,[Chorus],""... last call for alcohol, for my niggaz"",[Outro],So this A&R over at Rocafella, named Hiphop,picked the Truth beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him,I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do,I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin?"",I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay."",Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone,going back and forth, just askin me to send him beats,And I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers,cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with,And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID,And No ID told him, ""look man, you wanna mess with Kanye,you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"",[No ID:] ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap"",I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not,but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer,[Hiphop:] ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper"",,I'm like oh shit,I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also,People were like this, started talking about the Ghost production,But that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here,So you know. After they picked that Truth beat,I was figuring I was gonna do some more work,But shit just went poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago,I had my own apartment. I be doin' like, just beats for local acts,just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy,get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something,or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then,I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample,I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like ""oh, yo that shit is crazy,Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty."",And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me,so I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time,and really I just, like picked the drums off Xxplosive and put it like,with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style,when it started, when he rapped on 'This Can't be Life.',And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album,I could say that was the, the resurgence of this whole sound,You know, I got to come in and track the beat, and at the time,I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with,Hiphop. 'Cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm,sayin, 'cause I been there for a while, I appreciated what they did,for me, but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he,gotta make a change, try to move up to the next level. And that day I,came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, ""oh,you a real soulful dude"" [Jay-Z: ""you a real soulful dude""]. And he,uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got,to the studio, you know how he do it, one take. And he said,[Jay-Z:] ""check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here"",""tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking,like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z, I ain't,want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the, in my,personal opinion. So he asked me, ""what you think of it?"",[Jay-Z:] ""so what you thinkin?"",And I was like, ""man that shit tite,"",you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train,man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just,in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got,acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like,poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homeys that was one,of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through,my production company, but he ended up going straight with the,company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad,news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at,the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took,that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about,ten days before I had to actually get out. So I ain't have to deal,with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to,[Mother:] ""Come on, let's just go"",Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment.,I remember I pulled up,[Mother:] ""Kanye, baby, we're here"",,I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a,bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and,the first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City.',And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up,there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I,played like seven beats. And, you know I could see he's in the zone,he already had the beats that he wanted, I did nothing like already at,that time. But then Jay walked in. I remember he had a GuccI bucket,hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said,""yo play that one beat for him."" And I played 'Heart of the City.' And,really I made 'Heart of the City,' I really wanted to give that beat to DMX.,[Hiphop:] ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here"".,And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that,GuccI bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of,them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen,Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like ""yo what's up I'm Kanye."",[Dame:] ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?"",""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?,Yo, this nigga got classics"",[Dame:] ""Jay got classics, G."",You know I ain't talkin shit.,I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm,still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggaz on the show,The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my,eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all,these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one,thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be,Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton,sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think Tata, John,Minnelli, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the,time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I,spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical,shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his,eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the West, the rap,was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response.,He said ""man that was tite."",[Jay-Z:] ""That, that was cool. That was hot."",That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe.,Okay, fast forward.,So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just,took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship,with KwelI I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my,career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me,to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at,this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had,relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so,they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound,like Jay-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them,these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll,be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy,'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever,Everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they,didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked,with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the,company that'll say ""naw."" Like, Dave LottI fucked with me, my,nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man,[Jessica:] ""Man, you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real."",I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up,""Y'all niggaz is stupid"". Let's just say I didn't get my deal.,The nigga that was behind me, I mean,,he wasn't even a nigga, you know?,The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol,Records. He wanted to sign me really bad.,[Joe:] ""We gonna change the game, buddy."",Dame was like, ""yo you got a deal with Capitol,,okay man, just make sure it's not wack."",[Dame:] ""you gotta make sure it's not wack."",Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to,play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and,Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll,never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.',""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow,I got eleven plaques on my walls right now,You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."",Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So,I play that song for him, and he's like ""oh shit"",[Dame:] ""Oh shit it's not even wack."",""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."",[Dame:] ""it's actually kinda hot."",Like they still weren't looking at me,like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole,album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and,save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's,like ""yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick"",[Dame:] ""you don't wanna catch a brick"",You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.,I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with,that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was,already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you,know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I,was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm,not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer,rapper"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right--,the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do,man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio,sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes,man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said,""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal"",[Mel:] ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal."",And, you know I told them that Rocafella was interested,and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying,to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I,called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Rocafella?""
