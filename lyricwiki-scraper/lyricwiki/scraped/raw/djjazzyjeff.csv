,DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince,"Max and relax and listen to wherever you're at the story of how we came up with this hit tune,We worked for month's days hours and seconds,But we simply couldn't seem to finish the record,We needed more tracks so we hooked up symp t,But everything we tried kept coming up empty,We played the track back over and over,So Jeff said forget it man lets call Grover,I explained the trouble to my man GW,Said I'd be glad to help be there in a double to,Switch the mix and fix up the pitch,He looked at is horn and his hands started itchin,His lips got locked his horn got hot,There it is a serous biz jazz and hip hop,A lesson could be learned from this musical fusion,That if you can blend then in life your losing,Black white red yellow not for sections,Not for colours all one spectrum,This is for your ear to hear and teach and smooth,Grover Washington completed the puzzle to our groove,Jazzy's groove

and hoes,You try to sit but their ain't know spaces,The floor is a desert, a party oasis,I know your on the tip for the rhyme I just did,And here's a little taste of my homeboy, El Sid,Ay a prince it's the El Sid's version,I'm a raid on the track, I'm a hip-hop surgeon,The floor is jam packed get away from the bar scene,The strum of the drum has you trapped like a sardine,You try to move no form of escape,The heat brings on sweat, stick on like tape,Party's like a ???,Girls slim and trim on the floor,Don't try to shoot for the door,This ain't the gym,The party goers every night had a scene,This mic try to respond but still trapped like in Venus,Aint a spiff or a spoof,Boy you better not goof,You about to cave in although you ain't on a roof,The rhythm track from offside's to angles,Playing the wimp fight resist ... strangle,You can't escape until the DJ's fingers up,So play like a phone or coat and just hang it up,The speakers pumping out sounds and hip words,Lines between the rhythm designed to equip nerds,You better jam we don't care if you hardcore,Cause we got you trapped on the dance floor,[Chorus 2x],[Verse 3],Me and prince got together just to kick our lines,No trouble at the party cause we're strapped with nines,Dance floor secure, don't bother tryin to get out,You looking for the late AM this man pull red out,Nobody cause killing is mean,Got ya dancin' in the dark and dressed like Springsteen,Razzamatazz a pasazz about to rip the flesh is my man Jazz Fresh,Soon as I worked through the door,I got trapped on the dance floor,See this girlie that I never saw,She was looking raw,Came a little closer,Then I opposed her,Then I drop the fox trot so hot that I roast her,??? planes in the damn chain,hard to explain,I did it up like I was straight outta Soul Train,Listen as I discuss this yo bust this,Like a hammer before me you cant touch this,Trapped on the floor like a vulture,Part of my culture,You may even thought I was drived to faulter,Get live like a ???jack that fives you the window main???,Add a little mic and janet you cant understand it,Cause ??? thought I was from another planet,Way of whipping and dipping,And sliding ??? of what I'm providin,Other dancers go and hide,Like Charles ???,I'm prancin,I keep the dance all night until,The party's over the party's over,Like a cowboy at a rodeo,From mister mister dosie doe,Around the dance floor,Steppin the new hardcore,I'm Jazz Fresh and I'm trapped,[Chorus],[Verse 4],Max up to step up,just to keep this rap up,the time that he possesses the best in a contest,Jeff with his right and left like Jazz Fresh,No other than the brother the lover Jazzy Jeff,I'm the one dance floor at the station,??? time around quarter to ten,times work hard,the customers scarred,your tickets to freedom,yo you ain't gonna need em,your sentence is 25 years to life,a ??? is your husband and wife,trapped behind the steel,the steel of the wheels,don't come to the party if you don't wanna know how business feels,I walk strong carry a big stick,Sell myself all packed and thick,When they sound the drum you know its time to roll,Might as well have fun there's no parol,I set a trap and caught you like a mouse,For times ahead no chance for a halfway house,Pump the bass in all sections,Prince, sid, and jazz my officers of correction,Cant' escape the floor cut the crime out,??? wall ain't no use tryin to climb out,cause I'm running this show and it's live in here,you try to escape another five years,I got you trapped and I'm your savior,You dance real hard you might get out on good behavior,But if you don't I give you more,'Cause DJ Jazzy Jeff got you trapped on the dance floor,[Chorus 2x]

I'm 18! They must be jokin!,And by 10 my crib was smokin,All of my friends with their hands in the air,Screamin (PARTY OVER HERE, PARTY OVER THERE!),The party was jammin till at least about 5,And as my friends were leaving, they were like ""Homes, it was live!"",I thought the party was over, but really was just beginnin,I turned around I thought I was dreamin, I saw four women,Dressed in red leather, tight to their booties,I gestured with my index finger: come here, cuties,I tried to be chill, I didn't wanna scare em,I said, ""Hi, my name's the Prince,"" they said, ""Hi Prince, we're your harem"",I didn't waste time, I started shootin the gift,I said, ""Y'all the type of girls I'd like to spend some time with"",I walked upstairs, my adrenaline was pumpin,Til one hit me in the head with a lamp or somethin,The next thing I remember is wakin up nearly dead,With another Fred Flintstone lump on my head,Of course I was mad, this type of thing can burn at you,They tied me up and they were stealin my furniture,I said, ""Yo sweetheart, what's wrong with you?,What kind of stuff is this for a nice girl like you to do?"",She turned around and smiled and laughed,And that's the way that I noticed that the girlie had a mustache,Not four girls, four guys!,They were in disguise, it was a set up all the time,I made a complete fool of myself that day,My parents were pullin up just as the u-haul truck was pullin away,They walked in, looked like they seen a ghost,There I was, gagged and bound and tied to the bed post,My pop walked in and asked a brilliant question,""Son, where's the furniture and why is your room so messy?"",Obviously Sherlock Holmes hadn't arrived,I said, ""What do you think, dad, maybe we were robbed?!,I'm tied up, nothing's in one piece,Let's discuss the facts later, mom, please call the police"",I wanted to have a party, I thought I was clever,My pop told me I was on punishment forever!,And in retrospect I had to laugh,I can't believe I didn't notice that the girlie had a mustache

,DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince,"Ever since I was younger, I was into video games,Tron or whatever, it didn't matter the name,Thousands of my dollars, have been poured into all types of games, tryin to get the high score,But now I think I have a favourite,It's me against an ape, he's got my girl, I've got to save her!,Oh no, I feel an attach coming on,Yo Ready Rock C I wanna play a game of Donkey Kong,It used to be a problem this addiction I have,I would feel the urge, then I'd go stark raving mad,Break into the arcade, screaming and hollering,Anticipating putting twenty-five dollars in any machine, I was out of control,I didn't need quarters I brought, $10 bank rolls,Bags of quarters, I was insane,People thought that I worked there, and asked me for change,But I would get defensive and yell leave me alone,These are my quarters stupid, go get your own,Dude walked away with this look in his eyes like,,Yo man.. I wonder what's wrong with that guy,I was addicted, a video burn-out and I would crazy when the guy would have to turn out,The lights at midnight, I'd fall on my knees and say,,Have a heart pal, one more game please,Some nights I might sleep on the subway or outside of the arcade til it opened up the next day,And when it opened at a quarter to ten it was the same old thing all over again,I was doin bad my future was bleek,I'd rather play games than eat or sleep until one day, this guy came along,He didn't have a radio but he was playin a song,I got curious, so I said, yo what's that noise?"" (What noise? I don't know),No fool, that noise you was makin there (What this),Yeah,That was def man, where'd you learn to do that,(Man, I don't know, I guess I always knew that I had this talent deep down inside),You wanna hear some more man Yeah (Come on let's take a ride),He made sounds like I never heard before and he still had more,Then he got me hyped when he played this incredible song and I lost my mind when Ready C played Donkey Kong,Yo Ready, get funky with it!,Yo Jeff man what you doing? Give Ready a hand,Now my life is wonderful and I feel great,I haven't been in an arcade since seventy eight,Thanks to Ready C I'm on an upward trail,Because he's always by my side, he never fails me,Whenever I have a video attack,He's right there by my back keeping me on track,So if I bug out and act like a lunatic,He does Donkey Kong and as soon as it gets to my eardrums from his vocal chords,I get hyped up no matter how bored I am he always comes through,Oh my fault, hold up, wait, let me tell you who,Ready Rock C, here's a brief description,Of the things that he can do in his musical position,Ready Rock C makes sounds with his mouth,Yo Ready give an example of what I'm talking about,(game over),(Yo, Scrammy, why you still standin there),(The game is over haha sucker)

You don't know,Layin' up under some whole double waste,Just let me chill, no need for me to get ill,Cause yo I'm the best and yo time will tell,But I'll be here so ring my bell,Chorus,Verse 3,Now I know this sounds like a fairy tale,But this ain't no children's book,I'm here, for you to take me dear,Just open your eyes and look at what the future holds for you,And if you lunch then you might ruin,Something great don't make a big mistake,Pay attention to what you're doing,Life is full of pitfalls, ups and downs,It's sort of a mission,Now you're on a rocky road,But you could get up just make that decision,That you want the one to love adore you and hold you and treat you well,So when you're ready to be treated that way,Baby you can ring my bell,Chorus,(Repeat till fade)

,DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince,"Each and every day when I come home from school,Like clockwork I go up into my bedroom,I secure the door and it's the moment of truth,I flip on my sound system and let the bass loose,The earthquake bass makes the walls all tremble,A discotheque is what my room resembles,How loud it gets to me it does not matter,I open up the windows so the glass don't shatter,The blast falls off my neighbour's wall,My phone rings of the hook with complaint phone calls,But I just let it ring and I don't go near it,I turn the volume up so that I can't hear it ring,My ear drums rumble my lungs vibrate,I'm in my own world and this realm is great,We rock this power at my command,The decibels exceed the limits human ears can stand,The lower frequency better known as bass,Sitting nice with the treble at a jazzy pace,My neighbours complain they say they can't endure,They form a congregation outside my front door,Mothers who yell saying its too loud,Start banging on my door to turn it down,My response to my mother when she starts knockin,Is come on mum I'm just rockin ,(rockin),(ready rock c),This style that's mine is rarely heard,Suddenly there is an opportunity to observe,People gots my rhyme the super computer,The literary genius rhyme ruler of the future,I'm the fresh prince slaying all emcee,So hold the red cup when we take to your knees,Pay home submit you can't defuse my scheme,Cause I'm the fresh prince and this is my regime,To all other rappers you're being subdued,I don't mean to be rude but this is my prelude,This introductory performance has just one plot,A sample jeff and about me and my DJ rocks,I'm not listening to reason so don't try to talk,Do yourself a favour and take a walk,Or I'll amputate your mic and repossess your core,I'm the man salute to the prince the power lord,My friends I'll mangle you if we tangle put my arms in your asophogus and I'll strangle you,I'm the messiah or rhymes the verbal gladiator,I'm like a bomb and my turbo is the detonator,The crown chief of the poetry industry,Vocabulary that to others is a fantasy,highly respected by the public at large,The prince will rock is taking charge,I'm like a tiger in a battle field I'm invincible,You want a battle me man be sensible,I'll never submit to any other emcee,Be a duel to the death either him or me,And as I verbalise to my DJ's cut,If we kill a wack crew or two so what,We just rock it,We just rock it,DJ Jeff,Break 2,On each occasion that I perform,The force captures my body like a magical storm,Suddenly I'm rendered helpless in a state of shock,But it is rather abrupt when I start to rock,Adrenalin rushes my ego swells,And the yells of the crowd make my hype excel,My metabolism quickens my body gets sense,That's when I metamorphosise into the royal fresh prince,And as I display all my lyrical beauty,You become a slave as your hype increases,And as I vocalise I can see it in your eyes,You stand up as your enthusiasm levels rise higher and higher beyond the mark of red,You scream oh my to what the prince just said,As my energy is drained from being so crushed,All of a sudden I get another adrenalin rush,It happens each and everytime that my dj spins,More commonly known as my second wind,The spotlights are beaming,You are screaming,From my body all the sweat is streaming,Commanding the stage,And perpetually frayed,Giving my all to the pulse of,One hundred percent everytime I rhyme,When I step off the stage that's when the stop,And that has been the account of the evenings events,Reporting to you live by me the fresh prince,I'm the latest that you heard so you may seem shockin ,(what does it all mean),I'm just rockin,Rockin rockin rockin,Go crazy,(fresh)
