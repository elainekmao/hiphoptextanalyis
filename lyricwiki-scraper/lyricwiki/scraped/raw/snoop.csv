I'm caught up in the middle and I don't know what to do,I caught eight months in the joint, behind my crew,That I gotta do and I'ma miss you Boo,But I'ma write you every night and call you on the phone too,Whatchu gon' do?  ""You know I'm gon' stay true,But I'ma go ahead to college like my father want me to"",Well um, off to my cell withcha body on my mind,And I'ma call you back tomorrow round the same time,I'm on the mainline, 9500 for short,On another phoneline, holla'n at my other hoe,This bitch ain't sayin SHIT, cause the bitch ain't SHIT,Old fat golddiggin-ass county check receivin BEOTCH,I bail up in the Day Room and get in a scrap,Niggaz watchin Soul Train and I wouldn't turn it back (man fuck y'all),Never caught slippin, always on strap,And now I'm back in the hole with no motherfuckin getback,Sit back and contemplate, and think about baby,And hope she don't get caught up in the world that's so crazy,But while I'm up in Wayside, and she off in college,She gettin a little mo' than a schoolgirl knowledge,Cause gangsta-ass niggaz go to school nowadays,I tried to make you wait, but I can't change yo' ways,She fell in love with the local G,And now they both in the penetentiary, she didn't mention me,Chorus 2X

",Snoop Dogg:Your Sexy Sex
,Snoop Dogg,"Once upon a time, in the L.B.C.,On the Eastside, off of 2-1 Street,There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name,To make it interesting it's me, peep game,I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad,And two step-brothers who treated me bad,I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors,And I was like an errand boy runnin to the stores,My brothers, they used to boast and brag:,""We've got Fubu, and you've got rags!"",And even worse than that, to make me feel low,They gave me a skateboard, while they had low-lows,Girls used to say, ""Snoop, you're so cute,But you gets no rap with that to' up khaki suit"",Welllll, one day, up the Avenue,There was a man, surrounded by the Dogg Pound crew,He said ah, ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!,The princess is having a royal ball,If you can rap, also dress fresh,You might win a date with the sweet princess"",Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash,I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad,I said, ""Step-dad, may I?"",And before I could finish, ""Hell no!"", he replied (Cinderfella!),My brothers were goin, they were gettin down,Even Pops was goin for a piece of the crown (Cinderfella!),They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted,""We can and you can't,"" is what they taunted (nana-nana-nah-nah),They all stood there, laughin in my face,And as they walked out they said, ""Clean up this place!"",(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!),And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love,(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!),And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love,(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!),And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love,(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!),And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love,Well I shrugged, I hissed, they all tried to diss,And I'd get them back if I had one wish,Before I could make my thought a phrase,There appeared a man from a puff of haze,He said, ""What's up, Dogg? My name is Herb,I'm your fairy Doggfather, you know it, word!,Now I've came here with the main purpose,Of granting you your fondest wish"",I said, ""Herb, my man, just make me fresh,And I'm sure that I can handle, all the rest"",With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot,And I was jumpin in my body: a slick silk suit,On my feet was some white tube socks,And a fresh pair of Chucks from the Foot-lock,I showed him my sack, and don't you know,With a snap, the sack became some doe-doe,Once again his hands began to flow,Then he changed my skateboard into a six-fo' (damn!),He checked me over, passed me the keys,And said, ""One more thing before you leave...,You must return before the stroke of twelve,Or you'll turn back into your old self"",(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!),And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love,(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!),And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love,I jumped in the low-low and went on my way,I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say,It was after eleven when I rocked the mic,And by the time I left the stage, the people were hyped (well alright!),The princess was starin, while holdin a drank,Reflected from her eyes was gold tank,She waved her hands like, ""Hello!  Hi!"",Then gave another gesture like, ""Come here, guy!"",I left the stage, girls came in flocks,The bitch was swingin from the hard knocks,I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock,Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock,No time to waste, I broke out in haste,The princess followed in a futile chase,A quick steady pace is what I kept,Lost one of my Chucks on one of those steps,For the six-fo' I continued my stride,About this time I heard gong five,I was down the block when I heard gong eight,And the princess screamed out, ""Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!"",(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!),And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love,(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!),And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love,I was almost home when my luck ran out,And there went my suit, my doe sack and clout,My fresh low-low, also went too,And there was no denyin that my night was through,The one All-Star, the freshest thing I sported,Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded,Made it to my pad, no time at all,Went to my room, or better yet the far wall,Hid the shoe away, still feelin pleased,Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's,Early the next mornin, when I awoke,I threw on me old slippers with me old housecoat,Slid into the front, my family stared at me,Sayin, ""Wasn't that you?  Nah, it couldn't be"",They kept askin me if I did my chores,My butt was saved by a knock at the door,""Who is it?"", that's what my brothers barked,""The princess,"" this sweet voice remarked,She said she was lookin for a certain man,Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand,The family ran around with their heads in the air,Bringin her shoes from everywhere,She just shook her head, a nod of relief,And said, ""No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, Chief"",I ran in the room and got my shoe,And said, ""Is this the one you're referring to?"",Well she said, ""Yes, and you're so cute,But where's your doe-doe and slick silk suit?"",I put on the shoe, then there came a flash of light,And I was wearin shit, from just last night,Looked out the window, saw the six-fo',Yelled to my family, ""I've GOT to go!"",We drove up the Avenue, the princess and I,And in back of me, I heard my family cry...,(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!),And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love,(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!),And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love,(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

Warren G,He cut grass trasform wit finesse,......... and all that mess,I remember when we first started to rap,He tried to get this job at Calvin's record shop,He was in it to win it, but the boss front and said,Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted,Now my homie Warren still tried,On and on and on til the like break of dawn,To work at tha V-I-P would be the link,But they looked right past him so my homie straight dip,Now for the year after Regulate,Warren G is havin papers so my homies write straight,He walked into the same record shop as before,And the boss be like Warren welcome to my store,Offerin him a job but nah he don't want it,Damn it feels good to see people love Warren,Cause I remember when at first they wasn't,Now guess what they call sessy bussin,the vapors,They caught vapors,I got to talk bout me now,Last subject of tha story is about Snoop Dogg,I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog,When I was a teenager I tried to be down,And since they wasn't tryin to hear me I made the Dogg Pound,I saw a crew on 2-1 street,and said, 'Can I be down champ?' They said,no, and treated me like a wet food stamp,after gettin rejected, I ain't runnin upset,I said, 'What's a Dogg do to?'  Rhymes at rates,When I used to go to parties, they make me wait,What I have to get on the mic to set M-C straight,I ain't never love no hoe since I'm listenin to my music,They acted like I wanted to keep hangin with the juzi,But now things switched from West to East,Short Dogg do ya remember me from 21st street G?,'We used to see Daz, back in the day',It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed,You caught the vapors,You caught the vapors,You got the papers
