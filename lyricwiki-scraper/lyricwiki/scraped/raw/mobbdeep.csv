,Mobb Deep,"(Havoc),Sometimes I wish I had three different faces,I'm going to court for three cases in three places,One in Queens Manhattan one in Brooklyn,The way things is looking I'm 'ma see central bookings,Facing 3, 3 to 9 is mad time,After reconcurrence for assault 2 9,I gotta maintain 'cause stress on the brain,Can lead to a mothefucka suicide thing,And plus my provation a ill violation,How the fuck did I get in this tight situation?,I'm going all out you know moves I never fake,And fuck the jake digger  catch me at my way,And if I did burn a bag of blade,Put the light in the air sometimes I just don't care,(Prodigy),Son I got plans, power movements, get on some real shit,I keep living like this I might loose it,My man is coming home from doing long ass bids,What up Kiko? I ain't seen your ass since we was kids,It's all strange my nigga's locked down thinking long range,And see their names in the Daily news third page,They sent a kite to my nigga Killa,It only took one sword to put seven holes in his squila,A 3 to 9 spending most of his time inside the bin,Reclined, and still came home with a shine

Infamous (1995),Mobb Deep,"Yeah,Uhh, no doubt, son, word up,(Havoc),Word up, son, I heard they got you on the run,Filled with body, now it's time to stash the guns,They probably got the phone tap so I won't speak long,Gimme a half second and I'ma put you on,It's all messed up, somebody's snitchin on the crew,And word is on the street is they got pictures of you,Homicide came to the crib last night, six deep,axin on your whereabouts, so where d'you sleep?,They said they just wanna question you bet me and you know,that once they catch you, all they do is just arrest you,then arraign you, hang you, I don't think so,It's a good thing you bounced but now you're stayin low,Once in a blue I check ta see how ya doin,I know you need loot so I send it thru Western Union,They probably knock down the door,in the middle of the night, sometimes around four,Hopin to find who they're lookin for but they want ta see,All they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed,But worse, son, you got the projects hotter than hell,Harder for brothers to get their thug on but oh well,Son, they know too much, even the hoodrat chicks,Oh, you heard who did what and why I don't this shit,So stop askin, then I know I'm not goin crazy,From windows I see lights flashin and maybe,somebody's takin pictures,You know who that be, police lovers and neighbourhood snitches,They put up *?pertice?* so everybody's pointin fingers,and lyin, aiyo son, the temp is risin,Chorus:,The temperature's risin, no there's nothin surprisin,The temperature's risin, huh and nothin's surprisin,The temperature's risin, huh and there's nothin surprisin,The temperature's risin (There's nothin surprisin),(Prodigy),What up, black? Hold your head wherever you at,On the flow from the cops or wings on your backs,That snitch nigga gave police your location,We'll chop his body up in six degrees of separation,Killer listen, shit ain't the same without you at home,Phony niggas walk around tryin to be your clone,They really fear you, when you was at home you was pale,That's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail,By the time you hear this rhyme you probably be locked up,tried to hussle, where along the lines your plan slipped up,Got caught up in a crime that you can't take back,Reminisce on how I use to pick you up in the Ac,Years ago when we was younger seemed the hood took us under very deep,Wonderin who snitched and got me losin lots of sleep,at night, you know my mouth is tight,I never sang to the cops cos that shit ain't right,Sometimes I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack,Damn, why the situation go down like dat?,It'll be a long time before the heat dies down,In a couple of years, fool we'll see you around,But til then maintain and keep ya story the same,The cops is grabbin wrong niggas, lookin for someone to blame,They harrassin, strugglin to find the truth,Is it a chance ya case'll get thrown out cos they ain't got no proof,To say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy,Deliver me the gun, I'll tie two, quickly throw it in the river,Make sure it's safe to the bottom,Our smart police snuck you out at the projects, we got em,But still, but still, but still......,Chorus x3,(Surprisin),*repeat to fade*

I ain't seen your ass since we was kids,It's all strange my nigga's locked down thinking long range,And see their names in the Daily news third page,They sent a kite to my nigga Killa,It only took one sword to put seven holes in his squila,A 3 to 9 spending most of his time inside the bin,Reclined, and still came home with a shine
