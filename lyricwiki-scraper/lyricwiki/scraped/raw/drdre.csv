(Yo!),Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute,and bust this crazy shit,(Eazy-E),Woke up quick at about noon,Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon,I gotta get drunk before the day begin,Before my mother starts bitchin bout my friends,About to go and damn near went blind,Young niggaz at the pad throwin up gang signs,Ran in the house and grabbed my clip,With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip,Bailed outside and pointed my weapon,Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin,Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride,I got front back and side to side,Then I let the Alpine play,Bumpin new shit by NWA,It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list,Then I played my own shit, it went somethin like this:,Cruisin down the street in my six-fo',Jockin the bitches, slappin the hoes,Went to the park to get the scoop,Knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoops,A car pulls up, who can it be?,A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G,He rolls down his window and he started to say,It's all about makin that GTA,*chorus*,Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard,You come talkin that trash we'll pull your card,Knowin nothin in life but to be legit,Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin shit,(Eazy-E),Down on B's in the place to give me the pace,He said my man JB is on freebase,The boy JB was a friend of mine,Til I caught him in my car tryin to steal my Alpine,Chased him up the street to call a truce,The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce,Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge,One sucker dead, LA Times first page,*chorus*,(Eazy-E),Bored as hell and I wanna get ill,So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill,The fellows out there, makin that dollar,I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala,They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin,And from the 8-ball my breath start stinkin,Love to get my girl, to rock that body,Before I left I hit the Bacardi,Went to her house to get her out of the pad,Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad,She said somethin that I couldn't believe,So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave,She started talkin shit, wouldn't you know?,Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe,Her father jumped out and he started to shout,So I threw a right-cross and knocked his whole ass out,*chorus*,(Eazy-E),I'm rollin hard now I'm under control,Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll,I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother,I throw it in the gutter and go buy another"",Walkin home and I see the G ride,Now Ket is drivin Kilo on the side,As they busted a U, they got pulled over,An undercover cop in a dark green Nova,Ket got beaten for resistin arrest,He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess,Now G is cut for doin the crime,For defence on the boy, he'll do some time,*chorus*,(Eazy-E),I went to get them out but there was no bail,The fellaz start to riot in the county jail,Two days later in municiple court,Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork,Distruption of a court, said the judge,On a six year sentence my man didn't budge,Bailer came over to turn him in,Kilo G looked up and gave a grin,He yelled out ""FIRE!"", then came Suzi,The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi,Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her,Both up state for attempted murder,*chorus*

man,It's time to fight, unite and be a black man,Tone-Loc is on a positive change,Cause remember, we're all in the same gang,[Above The Law],Bein the pimps that we are,We're here to speak on a situation that has gone too far,Here at home in the ghettos of LA,Where a young black brother's not promised to see the next day,Cause we used to clock on the streets before we made beats,But fools just lay and prey on the weak,It don't depend on the color of a rag,Cause if you got what they want you know they gonna take what you have,Cause violence don't only revolve from drugs and thugs,And gangs that bang,Most times it's a political thang,Yeah, a couple of spots'll get popped,And if the government wanted to freeze it it could all get stopped,But they don't because they want it like

,Got your whole crew doing subpeonas,Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius,Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters,Keep it close, you can't beat us,While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this,I done made quadrapalegics outta these non-rappin rejects,While the whole world ejects your tape, it ain't no secret,That your shit sounds fake, you can't stop it my mind state,Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate,I'm like Two-Face, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell,From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like route canals,I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail,Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well,Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linkin' trials,Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels,Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now,Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?,I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild,Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW!,It's Swifty from the 313,Like I said no one is iller than me, unnhh!,[Bizarre],Me and Eminem and Mike,Drivin' down Van Dyke,Get my dick sucked late at night by a f**kin'

out of gas,Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook,Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook,F**kin' with the white boys got me back on crack,Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at,I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should,This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good!,Rob this little boy in his f**kin' paper route ,Throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell ""EVERYBODY GET OUT""!,My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece,'cause she found out I was havin' an affair with her 10-year old niece,No one, no one's iller than me,It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313,No one, no one is iller than me,It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313,[Eminem],Nobody better test me, 'cause I don't wanna get messy,Especially when I step inside this bitch, dick freshly,New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs,Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs,True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs,Whippin' 40-bottles like the f**kin' Pepsi clubs,Down a fifth, crack open a six,I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss,I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends,Who gives a f**k who they was,I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does,They probably don't be packin' anyways, do they Fuzz?,We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz,Mics get sandblasted,Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid,Sprayed your motherf**kin' crib up when I ran past it,F**kin' felon, headed to hell in a handbasket,Talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted,Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic,Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic,Furious four motherf**kers,Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters,Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me,[Fuzz],I run shit like an ass with legs,Massive lead to leave your cabbage red,Similar to your ass in a casket dead,Drastic spread of acid heads,Come to abort you like a bastard egg,That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs,Ask the feds from past the edge,Rockin' the most classic threads,Flashin' bread, roll down the window,Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red,You can get 'til that ass get red,Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him,I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem,Never writer's block, I block writers,My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters,Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick,Some bitch ran up screamin' GET THE COPS QUICK!,And got drop kicked, now she screamin' ""Stop it..."",Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit,Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scooter '97 crop pick,Sick a-ya'll
