wanna live my life (I don't need no),Everyday a celebration (self-control),One day I'ma leave this world,I wait for the revelation,(Bizarre),I wanna kill myself!,I'm still debating,In front of a Baptist Church masturbatin,Praying to Satan,Think I'm crazy cuz I smoke crack,Live on B with the mac,In a two family flat (Fuck it),Tired of getting hit in the face with a broom,My mom's on her period,My dad's in my room (Daddy no!),I got ten rocks that I need to get out,I sold 'em in five minutes,In my own damn house,(My mom smokes crack),My poor grandmother,God bless her soul,The bitch got AIDS,She was waiting to die of a cold,There's three things to keep me from being a Nazi,I'm black, a fag, and my dad's Liberace,(Kon Artis),No matter how bad the beating,I went to school cheating,My dad whooped my ass at a PTA meeting,Skipping school, I had to have nuts just to do it,Got born and became truant,When I had the gaul to go,I just couldn't do it,I was lured into corners by this peer pressure shit,How would you feel if you was held,By the tip of a barrel,Getting threatened to get your skin,Ripped to bone marrow,Bet suburban kids,Never got rushed for their apparel like me,Outcast,Last to class,First to leave,When the teacher called on me,Best believe,I had something up my sleeve,(Eminem),I been praised and labeled as crazy,My mother wasn't able to raise me,Full of crazy rage,An angry teenager,Nothing could change me back,Gangsta rap made me act like a maniac,I was boosted and,So influenced by music,I used it as an excuse to do shit,Ooh I was stupid,No one could tell me nothing,Hip hop overwhelmed me,To the point where it had me in a whole 'nother realm,It was like isolating myself was healthy,It felt like we was on welfare but wealthy,Compelled me to excel when school had failed me,Expelled me,And when the principal would tell me I was nothing,And I wouldn't amount to shit,I made my first million and counted it,Now look at it,A fucking drop-out that quit,Stupid as shit,Rich as fuck,And proud of it,Thats why...,(Chorus),I don't wanna go to school (I don't need no),I don't need no education (education),I don't wanna be like you,I don't wanna save

and mask,Steadily beating my psychiatrist's ass,Just for asking about my past,I was never on that punk shit,Fucking around could get your beloved abducted,Smothered in blood quick,You couldn't pay Swift to give a fuck,Was crazy like my father,It must have been poison in that nigga's nutt,Far as probation,Fuck peeing in cups,I violate it anytime,Let 'em see the blunt,I grew up steadily masturbating inside a cell,Drunk as hell,Having conversations with myself,You could tell I wasn't leniant,A disobedient lynch,that slapped teachers,Bitch I'm not reading it,You don't know what dogs go

ignores me and I don't like that,They don't even listen when I tell 'em,I'll be right back,This nice beautiful house mom?,It don't mean shit,Cuz you know Daddy's a drunk,And he don't clean shit,And yesterday he hit me like a grown fucking man,I couldn't stand up to him,I just ducked and ran,I'm sick of this,I wish on Christmas,That I can get a loaded four-fifth,And put a fucking end to this

out,(Proof),when schools over,Pupil or people to shoot through,Kids going cuckoo,With a two-two,Since my friend is this new dude,In his high school,Losing his noodle,Learning people don't like you,The football jocks is,Spitting on him,Popular kids in school that's now picking on him,Burn out youngsta niggas now hitting on him,And his teacher in his English class keep flipping on him,And now he's grounded with no allowances,For drinking forty ounces,Cuz he was caught by his counselors,And why the fuck I gotta ride the bench coach?,Already got expelled for wearing a trenchcoat,All I ever seen is,(Violence, violence),Told me to keep silent,Stop batting my eyelids,It's apparent that my parents weren't parents at all,That's why I blow out my brains,and murdered you all...(FUCK YOU),(Chorus:
