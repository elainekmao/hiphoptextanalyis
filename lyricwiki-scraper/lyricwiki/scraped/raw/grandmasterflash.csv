love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too,So let me take you in my arms, let me fill you with my charms,Chaka, 'cause you know that i'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka,I'll make you more than just a physical spell,I wanna rock you Chaka baby 'cause my name is Melle Mel,Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off,Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!),Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off,Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft,I was sitting on the corner just a wasting my time,When i realised i was the king of the rhyme,I got on the microphone and what do you see huh!,The rest was my legacy,I was born to be the king of the be bop swing,To have Stallions and medallions, big diamond rings,To own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold,'Cause rap is the game that i control,I'm like Shakespeare, i'm a pioneer,Because i made rap something people wanted to hear,See before my reign it was the same old same,You took ""the ba with the ba"",That's street-talk game ,So if you ever, let me make this clear,If you ever think that we're stepping out of here,You ever think you're getting up, down, around or in huh huh!,You better think again my friend,Because the door is closed and we're in town,And the only place you can go is down,Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off,Well, i'm Keith Cowboy and you're my cow,So what ya M.C's gonna do now?,It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan,You won't even get bread and water my man,Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks,With another wack rapper tied to your back,And if you wanna hang yourself out to dry,It's the beautiful round up in the sky,I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's at cock,I'll be carrying out bodies stiff as a rock,Carrying out a million dollars in my pockets and hand,But i carry out orders from no man,'Cause anything you wanna do i already did,You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid,But in my M.C school, my class was packed,And tricks were for kids so i left your ass back,The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another,I'll buy a mansion for my mother,A 24/7, the kool-aid smile,Say hey Track 11, look at my power,Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off,Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!),Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off,Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!),Step, Step, Step, Step,

that ya chump ya own hand,You one-girl-at-a-time getting M.C,So how could you think that you rank with me?,If you only did your homework you would surely find,When Scorp get girls, they all be fine,And the only girl that you could take of mine,Is the one that i left way behind,And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash,You need to go to the bank and get some cash,Because talking don't pay, you're drifting away,When i see you on a stage i'm a blow you away,You're right, there is no difference between me and you,Except i look good and you look Through,Take that!,Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off,Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!),Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off,Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft,Little pieces of a dream is all you mean,Since the day you stepped in to the M.C scene,Biting your moves, taking fake awards,Saying everyone else was perpertrating a fraud,But your nothing but a clone of my flesh and bone,Now you trying to play grown on the microphone,But i'll tell ya 'bout a night, and ya know i'm right,When you listen to us rocking to the broad daylight,And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss,But then you prayed to God that you could be like us,Then God was great and God was true,And he tried to show you how to be like you,But you still didn't get where you wanted to go,When you gathered in a group and got your own show,'Cause without the source, the force won't survive,For eternity the source is alive,You forgot the words of your creator,And now he's made you a perpertrator,Forever in a world of you and a girl,A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl,You must spread the word of the master teacher,Or you die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat ya,The words are a gift we will never flaunt,That's why were gonna get everything we want,'Cause like a shadow in the night, i'm the sight unseen,And i'm the bona-fide vocal master supreme,And i'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents,'Cause my rhymes make vowels plus they make sense,See i'm down with Cowboy, you will rock the show,With King Lou, Tommy Gun and huh! Scorpio,Kami-Kazi, Clayton Savage and Easy Mike,And going down in the books is the king of the night,So if you're ever in a battle, i'm a make you my slave,And i'm a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave ,Leave behind all your fame and wealth,So you can say one rhyme then bury yourself huh!,I may sound possessed, but you know i'm blessed,With the will to make sense of all this mess,I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky,And i'm the only M.C that'll never die,So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top,But when you se Melle Mel you're gonna have to drop,RAAH!,And not only that!,Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off,Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!),Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off,Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft,Now for all you M.C's, you heard my story,On my superfly cold crushin' fame and glory,How i rocked the children and the young ladies,I even rocked the countries that was overseas,'Cause i can rock anybody from any crew,Because i did it to Chaka, i'm a do it to you,I'm a show ya how i rocked it y'all all night long,But when i rock with Chaka Khan i just said,Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan,I said let me rock you that's all i wanna do,Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan,I said let me rock you 'cause i feel for you,Chaka Khan won't you tell me what you wanna do,Do you feel for me the way i feel for you,Chaka Khan let me tell you what i wanna do,I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too,So let me take you in my arms, let me fill you with my charms,Chaka, 'cause you know that i'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka,I'll make you more than just a physical spell,I wanna rock you Chaka baby 'cause my name is Melle Mel,Say what y'all,Say what!,To the D.J's scratch, you've met your match,'Cause were coming out fresh with a brand new batch,So taking you off into the galaxy,It's Vicious, Vicious, Vicious Lee!,Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off,Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!),Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off,Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft Yeh,Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off,Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!)

Read all the bad news on the war for peace that everybody would lose,The rise and fall, the last great empire, the sound of the whole world caught on fire,The ruthless struggle, the desperate gamble,The game that left the whole world in shambles,The cheats, the lies, the alibis,And the foolish attempt to conquer the skies,Lost in space, and what is it worth, huh?,The president just forgot about Earth,Spending multi billions, and maybe even trillions,The cost of weapons ran into zillions,There's gold in the street, and diamonds under feet,And the children in Africa don't even eat,Flies on their faces, they're living like mice,And the houses even make the ghetto look nice, Huh!,The water tastes funny, it's forever too sunny,And they work all month and don't make no money,A fight for power, a nuclear shower,And people shout out in the darkest hour,Of sights unseen and voices unheard,And finally the bomb gets the last word,Christians killed Muslims, and Germans killed Jews,And everybody's bodies are used and abused, Huh!,Minds are poisoned and souls are polluted,Superiority complex is deep rooted,Leeches and lice's, and people got prices,Egomaniacs control the self-righteous,Nothing is sacred and nothing is pure,So the revelation of death is our cure,Hitler and Caesar, Custer and Reagan,Napoleon, Castro, Mussolini and Begin,Ghengis Khan and the Shah of Iran,Mixed with the blood of the weaker man,The peoples in terror, the leaders made the error,And now they can't even look in the mirror,âCause we gotta suffer while things get rougher,And that's the reason why we got to get tougher,To learn from the past and work for the future,And don't be a slave to no computer,âCause the Children of Man inherits the land,And the future of the world is in your hands,So just throw your hands in the air,And wave âem like you just don't care,And if you believe that you're the future,Scream it out and say âOh yeah!'
