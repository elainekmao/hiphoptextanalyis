Ludacris is almost out of his deal,I'm over ten million sold, every album is CRACK,And for now I'm bout to carry Def Jam on my BACK,Mad rappers I hear you talkin way down at the bottom,Though I make big money, still handle small problems,The ramblin at the mouth, I don't PLAY THAT SHIT,I'm the best and I ain't really got SAY THAT SHIT!

,Ludacris,"[Ludacris],I met this chick in motor city and her name was Lexus,Ass outta control and her chest was reckless,So we exchanged numbers, plenty calls and textes bout gaining,New friends and ex'ing our exes,In the back of my mind I just wanted to sex this,Gotta give her the D and some pearls as her necklass,SO I had her for dinner, woke her up for breakfast,Around 7:13 like Houston, Texas,She's everything I hoped for in the bedroom,And like Tyra Banks I need some headroom,Cause she can suck a golf ball through a garden hose,I never sat her on the bench she my starting hose,I'm on point at Game time, y'all be garden hoes,Yeah she never plays games like the Parker bro?,And we be drinking Conjure by the cases,Meanwhile your girl's been exchanging f-ck faces,[Trey Songz],You must be used to all the finer things,Infatuated by what money brings,It seems to me you hoes will never change,(Hoes wont ever change),So all that's left is for us to exchange,[Lil Wayne],I met her at a restaurant, she was a waitress,One day I went in and sat at her table,She asked me what will I be having, I said the basics,""Well done steak, vegetables and potatoes"",She asked if I will be having a drink, I said later,Bring me a glass of vodka and a chaser,As me and my homie sat and discussed paper,I could feel a fire burning me like a laser,I could see her thighs through uniform pants so I didn't leave a tip,I left her an advance, along with my number saying give me a call,And you know I didn't have to leave my name at all,She called me when she got off,So I invited her to my loft,And she flew over like a moth thing,You know she came straight up outta all of that cloth,We had a couple blunts and some champagne,Then she massaged all of my back pains,Then it became time for her to pack things,I said hit me up again, we do the same thing,Jumped in the shower, got out and sawa text message,It had a smiley face and said ""you the best sexy XOXO!"",I replied I love your f-ck face,[Trey Songz],You must be used to all the finer things,Infatuated by what money brings,It seems to me you hoes will never change,(Hoes wont ever change),So all that's left is for us to exchange

repeat 2X, minus ad libs],[Outro: Bishop Eddie Lee Long],What you just heard is real life,It's real life for you, it's real life for many,It's about where you been, yet at the same time you,Ay, you find yourself, in the midst of conflict and turmoil,Yes I'm talkin to you, in the midst of conflict and turmoil,Cause you realize HEY - it's, time to change right now,And in the middle of that I wanna say this,The Bible says that when I was a child, I spoke as a child,I understood as a child, I fought as a child,Hey, but when I became a man,I put away those, childish things,Did you not know that your environment has shaped you?,Where you were born, in the projects, in the ghettoes,In the upper downtown, wherever it was,The people around you, the things around you,cause you to do strange things because, you were seeking to learn,But what you learned, was on the streets, and not in the book,God called you a prophet,When you open up your mouth, everything of God comes out,And it commands attention, it commands change,I'm talking about the power, that's inside of you,And in the midst when you're, starting to understand,that I caught the wrong message, and now it's time,I'm hearing from God, what amazing experience, as you hear from God,He said, ""Is there forth any man be in Christ, he is a new creation"",Old things are passed away, somebody needs to hear that and behold,Everything becomes new, and when everything becomes new in you,It's time to stop the killing,I said it's time to stop the stealing,It's time to stop disrespecting our women,It's time for us to come home and raise our children,It's time for us, to really mold our communities,It's time for us, not to get hooked up in religion,But to get hooked up in relationship, with God,And the amazing thing about it,is wherever you find yourself right now, you can confess,and you can tell God ""I'm sorry;,I had the wrong cue, I was doing the wrong thing,I was going after things that I thought were right, but it wasn't right,And now that I'm getting it right, I'm asking you to forgive me,And I may have done the things, that they said I did,But I'm not, who they say I am; I am who you made me to be,and I'm changing in that, and it takes a few moments,But every time I fall down, I'll get right back up,And every time I make a wrong turn, I'll get myself back in line,Because I recognize, I have been called, for such a time as this!"",You can't resist the change,And you're not condemned by your yesterday,If you can grab hold of your now, and move in your destiny,Move, change, and be, now!,[Chorus Three: sung by choir],Searchin so looooong, lost in the clouuuuuds,Tryin to stay strooooong, and make you prouuuuud - make you proud!,Took me some tiiiiime (took me some time) now I seeeee,Heeeee resiiiides (Heeee resiiiides) in me (in me yeahhhhh)

Release Therapy (2006),Ludacris,"[Intro],The time has come...for bad things to leave,The time has come...for life to begin,The time has come...for the war of the gods,Yes..,It's that time,I'ma take the subtle approach first,Cause I'm just gettin started,Let's go,[1st Verse],Look, I'm the best and there's nothing that you can do about it,Never needed a publicity stunt, let's tell the truth about it,Even in the core of the streets, you can't sway the youth about it,But keep runnin yo mouth, and I swear I'ma knock a tooth up out it,I never claimed to be nuthin but who the fuck I am,Never sold cocaine in my life, but I'm still the fuckin man,Understand, nuthin you did makes you better nigga,You claim the streets, but the streets respect that chedda nigga,Luda got twice as much yo life you can charge it to 'em,I fit four of your houses inside my daughters room,And still have room for young Karma to play,Givin back to the children of tommorrow, for good karma today,So you can say whatcha wanna say, and you can talk that talk,But real niggaz ain't doin no talkin cause we walk that walk,Album for album you can see I got a multimillion plan,So call yourself whatever you want cept the multimillion man,[2nd Verse],How many times is you gon rap about busting your gun,How many times is you gon trap without busting your gun,Only shots you ever took were subliminal to the general,Disrespectin those doin real time with real criminals,And I ain't never did a day in my life,But it should be illegal to walk a day in my life,I paid the price and the cost to be the boss so you can rest your mouth,I'm universal, Luda never limits himself to the south,I give a damn about ya hootin and hollerin, and it ain't botherin ME,I hear you talkin but you ain't made it to THREE,You know where I live, but you ain't made it to ME,You ain't made nigga,I'm havin a house party, kid come get played nigga,You got played, my record label never jerked me,So shoot me, stab me, but words will never hurt me,I feed off your energy, my powers with God,So it's even better if you make ya diss record real hard...

Act a fool,If you about to get drunk and you ready to mob,Boy whatcha gonna do? Act a fool,Verse 2,Let's take it to the street cause I'm ready to cruise,Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes,And the people just stare so I love to park it,And I just put a computer in the glove compartment,With the pedal to the floor, radar in the grill,TV in the middle of my steering wheel,It's my car's birthday so we blowin' them candles,More speakers in my trunk than my ride can handle,Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep,NOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat,And when I roll up to da club, I get all the affection,Cause the women love the paintin they can see their reflection,I'm about to take off, F what you heard,Because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin' bird,And the fools, we gon clock one and we'll pop one,Cause my folk ridin' shotgun with a shotgun,Chorus,You just got hustled for a wad of cash,Man whatcha gonna do?
