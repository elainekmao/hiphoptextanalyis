You can't escape,When the Tribe is in the house, that means nobody is safe,How can a reverend preach, when a rev can't define,The music of our youth from 1979,We rap about what we see, meaning reality,From people bustin caps and like Mandela bein free,Not every MC be with the negativity,We have a slew of rappers pushin positivity,Hip hop will never die yo, it's all about the rap,So Marion Barry smokin crack, let's preach about that,The trash you talk won't matter, that old bogus chatter,The more that you condemn us, it only makes us phatter,When I talk, I know I'm talkin for you poppers all around,You know you love the sound, we gets down,chorus:,Q-Tip:,I'm the cherry on the top of yo ice cream,I'm the wish you thought inside your dream,Listen to the way we pulsate the jam,I'm the nigga here with the mic in hand,Styles that we present are just a few,To do away with you and your hum drum crew,This is '93 and the shit is real,Black people unite and put down your steel,Ladies make a forum on your sexual drive,Devoted to your lover and make it thrive,The riff was of F, I'm a hip hop body,Release the energy like the force of a shotty,Standin on the wall with my Polo on,Talkin to the girl with the Liz Claiborne,Keep the poetry in my black knapsack,Got my Timbo horse and my Doublemint pack,Hit the city streets to enhance my soul,I can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls,With a kick, snare, kicks and high hat,Skilled in the trade of that old boom bap,I can do a trick with the opposite breed,I used to down 40s and smoke grain weed,Now, I'm doin shows with half loot down,Now it's time for me to take ya uptown,It's like that man, it's like that (yes!)

,A Tribe Called Quest,"Yo, we all got different things we got to deal with. we always are trying,To put the blame on something else rather than sometimes looking at,Ourselves, recognizing a lot of the stuff that happens...but if we look,Within ourselves, we could prevent a lot of this nonsense. it's about,Relating back to the essence, where it all stems from. i'm-a do my thing,Over this drum, like a native tongue.,Verse one,Q-tip:,Do what you will, if you feel that your steeze is real,Complicated with the skills over reel to reel,Brown skin is what I feel, my mind and body's appeal,Is to the no-frill mills, who hear the beats to chill,Constantly, I'm hearing black americans just sneering,Looking for a leader who can fill us up with either,Hitting us up with great emotional chat,About the fact,That the black,Is constantly held back,Like 50 tracks back in a relay race,And the white team's ahead,So let's keep up the pace,And I be needing something,To feed my logical taste,At the end of the race is there a paradise place? ,Yo, we can't get involved in what the next man is doing,Material gain we put too much in persuing,Yo duke, I need this dough so we can step to this party,But we can all mardi grati,Minus that shit in our body,What that got to do with that,'cause kid that's the essence,,Your physical presence,Embodies every lesson,You can't run the rolls royce if the engine is busted.,Can't even life the knife to cut the mustard.,What we need to do first,Now listen to this verse,Let's concentrate on our spiritual plate.,Recognize your existence in this vast blue space,From a tiny cloud of blood,To the human beings with taste, sight, touch, smell,And sound,Let's deem it profound!,And prioritize this cause it was allah's wish,Allah? I'm god,No I ddon't believe that. that's a mystery,If God is so good why does shit be happening to me? ,There's divinity within,Because we come from the divine,A froce that's not seen but you feel it every time,When the wind blows, and the world turns,,And the rain drops, and the baby cries,And the bird flies, and the ground quake,,And the stars gleam,So many things are eident of it's existence,What we need to do is link it with persistence,Once we recognize that, we can move ahead,Native tongue, common sense yo he's hip-hop bred...,Common:,From the spiritual world my former life has developed,First person I lost close to me was stella,Some of my mellows,Lost their mothers and their brothers,For them I feel empathy,But I ain't pouring out no liquor for no niggas,I pour my heart out when I see dot out on the deck,Knowing two weeks ago he slapped-box with death,I hear of niggas dying in the wind-in the news,But when it's somebody you know it hits you,And emotions get bruised,I ain't been in your shoes,,I won't judge you for knocking,Because the spirit of the ghetto says you gotta!,They snatch you again from rock flippin',Give back into the neighborhood, you better start kickin',Stickin' stores,On the strip,I'm tired of arabs giving me my change back,Devil bomb my yesterday,My tomorrow he never gave back,I lay back, looking at the ceiling,Wonndering what can I do,So my homie won't have to be dealing,Not cause you serving and I'm rapping I'm better,Just different pieces to the puzzle of black life,That we have to put together, better ourselves,Cause families we gotta raise,No matter how long the money,Shorter become the days,Men become like women,And no difference in the season,If you got popped five times,You breathing for a reason,Let's put the five tenure plan into progression,Before we count our paper,Count our blessings

The jazz to move that ass,Cuz the Tribe originates that feelin' of pizzazz,It's the universal sound, best to brothers on the ground,And the ones six below, ya didn't have to go,Some say that I'm a sinner cuz I once had an orgy,And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies,If this is a stinker, then call me a stink, I ask,""What?

,A Tribe Called Quest,"Verse One: Phife Dawg,1988 Senior Year at Garvey High,Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly,Loungin with the Tipster, coolin with Sha,Scopin out the honeys - they know who they are,I was the b-ball playin, fly rhyme sayin,Fly girl gettin but never was I sweatin,Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll,Until I met my match - her name was Flo,Yeah - I messed around with the one called Flo,All the troopers round the way used to call her a ho,But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go,Cause I thought it was me - like Bell Biv Devoe,But little did I know that she was playin' with my mind,The only thing I've learned is, good girls are hard to find,I feel like Heavy D I need somebody for me,Not someone who's mind is blank and tryin' to juice me for my bank,Swingin' with my main man Lucky behind my back,What type of crap is that - yo, hows about a smack?,Word life, I can't front - thought I was all that,But now it seems, I met my match,Was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack,Settlin' down with one girl, wasn't tryin' to hear that,I had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen,Tina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy,Used to love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em,Find 'em, lose 'em - also abuse 'em,My whole attitude was new day, next hon,And believe it or not, they all got done,Well here comes Flo, with the crazy whip appeal,And I'm all true man, like Alexander O'Neal,Is this really love, then again, how would I know,After all this time tryin' to be a superhoe,She finally played me, but yo, I'd find another,Cause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter,Chorus: Q-Tip,Butter, like butter baby . . .
