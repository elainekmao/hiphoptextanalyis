A game?,One hundred years short, know the soul is immortal,Walk through many portals, and those who go astray,will pay a judgment day, and these few years of wicked bullshit,ain't worth the eternity inside a sulfur lake,With dragons and snakes, and any pain you can imaginate,Instead, I chose to become a newlywed to the true bread,of life and fed God Degree of light to my head,It's been said, the fool who sleep is already dead, so I stay awake,And take care of my brother, and uncover reveal the skin,so we can see each other, cause every color,that makes the light appear duller, who's the colored man?,Who's the original, who's the biochemical,Who's the grafted digital, digital, digital, digital,Digital.. yo, yo, yo, yo, yo,Two hundred thousand million atmosphere cubic feet of air we breath,While niggaz minds are trapped twenty thousand fathoms beneath,the sea of reality, they can't inhale deep, devils have em,Stagnant, a trapping, the .45 magnum,And shatter bone fragments,Cops love the block you gettin backed up by Dragnet,Thrown into a six by eight steel cabinet,Flippin weights readin ancient tablets, back on the block nobody's havin it,Those who haven't learnt get returned,You freaky ass niggaz get burned,Some walk around like they ain't concerned,with the hell goin on inside the world,Why do grown men molest little girls?,Is it because the girl's breast has swelled,to the size of a woman, although she's twelve,The whole world is sick, sick, sick,Trapped up in six, six, six,I started off as a pawn in this marathon of life,Tryin to carry on, wishin I had a bomb to blow up Babylon,A vagabond, tryin to steal his corpse we're from paragon,goin in circles, like a ferris wheel,Undernourished meals I cherish hope, drown inside the sea of life,Use my third eye for a periscope, and take flight to the edge of night,To far heights so dark that even wit a bright light,you couldn't see a spark of light,While others play ball, I recall, me and GZA, Dirty,hangin in halls, bangin on walls,Kickin rhymes three hours straight with no pause,Boostin from Freeport sunrise to Amityville morgue,Kept razorblade between the jaws, breakin all laws,Started out writin fables to makin beats on lunchroom tables,to wearin long cables that hung down to the navel,So pack some crack and fat sacks of skunk,to funnel the P-Funk, smokin woolie blunts,Dust cocktails and primos, shot more dice than casinos,Back when Wu-Gambinos were called F.O.I. MC's,All and together now crew B.C.C.,REC Posse, G.P., D.M.D.,Ol Dirty stalked East New York GZA maintained Franklin Lane,I was going to Thomas the Jeff, where students got slain,Old Earth got nervous walked me to Shaolin sent me to Curtis,Took share time in Marquis, U-God general contractin service,While Meth Chef and Deck was off the Nu-dol,For white boys who took steroids,Buildin up bicep tricep pectoids and deltoids,Back when our girlfriends was virgins,Cuttin class with Ghost tryin to bag hoes in Mary Birchem,A Maybeldine beacon night school Washington Irving,These young Gods was seekin,Hoes in Westinghouse and Clara Parton and Medina,Girls who sung like Sarafina,On the corner of Belmont and Picket Avenue I seen her,As if I dreamed her,I was dead broke, now I will use key notes to make G-notes,So it's always hope,See subway train run through the city like blood through the veins,To the heart of Medina, but Shaolin is the brain,So take heed to these words,And feel the power of the Sunshower,Approachin the final hour,Power equality, Allah sees everything,Let's come together under the wings,And take flight, Wu-Tang, the saga, Ryzarecta,In your sector

track, flip the obstacle,Now my proposal, rips the global,From California to courts, it's over God, so taste the soulful,Remember baggy jeans, Timberlands in November,Shorty called me Santa in December,But guess what, my Wally's got messed up,Autograph pressed what, blast enough to blow your rest up,We scrape that, Land O' Lake that,Mizola rapper get you sent back,Represent the gentlemens who bent that,Flash medallions like Italians,La costra nostra, we moving through your hood like we supposed ta,(Flex this) Lex and Diamonds hold the settlement,So keep the bust the gun Boo,Like that

with these pointy ass rings,No more said, knew your chump ass was dead,When I saw the four four reflecting off your shiny forehead,It's Wu-Tang nigga, ain't nothing changed nigga,Still shame on a nigga, who tried to run game,Get virgin and perversions, fucking bitches with Persian,Bugs watching niggaz like the turgeon, it's the surgeon slugs,still pounds when Bobby Steels 12 gauge gonna pay deadly chronicles,We, held up in Gotham take heed and protect your seeds,We fall like all the leaves, who lack tranquility,In your rap utility to fuck with the abilities,Raised like a sperm cell to the ovary,Microphone post tone like a rotary phone,Age of poems and poetry, old sloans,Explosive head bullets, black hooded,Timbaland footed ninjas, who full metal jacket clips,And know how to put it in you,Surrender your goods and your merchandise,For no purchase price, I'm certainly a heist,For your ice and curtains and vice,Come quietly, Wu-Tang Clan rules society,Because of variety, so maintain your high anxiety,And lead them to defy me, diary...,I need 18 points for my next joint,This high anointed king, to make a deal,I be the one to appoint, Steve Ripken must have been sniffing,To catch something so dope, it left Monica Lynch's pussy dripping,I fuck hundreds of bitches, and split millions of dollars,And built with thousands of scholars,My life saga from the hill to the harbor,Legal kid brown in Nicaragua,Gave birth to MC's, theives and bank robbers,We drove with pistol whips into world-wide trips,And my dick's been sucked by the finest lips,Stand to tell the contestants, in the world's best repressment,But none of the above compare to the one-twenty lessons,Or my queen and my seeds, in the home that I rest in,Enter my zone get blown to 99 sections,(Method Man),This rhyme has no limitations, this time there's no hesitation,Collecting minds at the door, you want it niggaz it's yours,The flavors raw, what the fuck you think I'm flowing for,It's rhyme and reason, bite the bullet,Niggaz is foul in this duck season,We add odds till we even motherfucker,Bad asses, high times, lower classes,Taste mine, straight shots in dirty glasses,Bring it to him, room service, under pressure,And mad nervous, waving guns at the clergy,Ticallion, we ain't worried,Keep them sick niggaz seven-thirty,Picture this, watch the birdy,This bastards is rolling dirty,With sharp pins that be stabbing you,Pins and needles, needles and pins,Nuff said, dick in your mouth,Like pimp was bled, as I race track with thoroughbreds,Ducking the feds,(Raekwon the Chef),Yo, my ice slow fly up on the keyboard son,Niggaz ran up on me law, praising what we do by the lords,That's right, exile the fake, hit them niggaz like weight,Feed a fool, let the fake evaporate,Reconstruction, that's the whole science of mine,Production, ya'll niggas guess who stuck son,Left his nuts son, switch, finger itch,Staring at you like a bitch, maybe y'all niggaz snitch,You'se a loner, Adidas shell top while I...,sipping Corona, read the rev report then bone her,Buy you some jewels, here's some food,Not neccessarily mean to be rude boo, check out the analoo,We in the mushrooms, chased the high neck in the custom,Baggy jeans, thick ropes god, sliding through customs,Chill, y'all niggaz know what time it is,James Bond Beamers behind me, on Bacardi Lime and,check out the pitch like Nolan

the sleeper hold,Not a role model, I walk a hard role to follow,I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels,The gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole,Mentally they fold, and they eventually sold,their life and times, deadly like the virus design,but too, minute to dilute, the science is mine,You can't party your life away,Drink your life away,Smoke your life away,Fuck your

revealing,It's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen,Zero process, progress, become the hunted,America's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it,Some love the speed, some satisfy a need,Some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed,The stronger speed, someone die, someone bleed,One flew astray, and then caught my little seed,Can it be, the ice have us trife life, made me
