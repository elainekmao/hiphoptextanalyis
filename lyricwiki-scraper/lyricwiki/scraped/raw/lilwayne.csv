I know somebody home ,Don't leave me knocking' baby ,All you gotta do is bring that car ,And we can get it poppin' baby.

,Lil Wayne,"Pray To The Lord Lyrics,(Chorus: x2),Before I Sleep I Pray To The Lord,My Soul To Keep,And If I Should Die,Before I Wake,I Pray To The Lord,My Soul To Take,For Goodness Sake,Yeah I Wrote My Will Just The Other Week,And Whats Funny, It Was Only One Sheet,And I Know Its Only One Me,But I Hope I Am Everything My Son Be,Im Trying To Live Right, Stay On That Drum Beat,But Im In The Fast Lane, In The Front Seat,I Wonder Will I Loose Control Of The Mazarati And Hit Some Tree Just Being,Young Me,Is There A Heaven For G's And Soldiers? I Cant Go To Hell, Cause Ima Take Over,I Feel It Approaching, But I Aint Scared,I Made That Bed, And I Should Rest In Peace,(Chorus: x2),Before I Sleep I Pray To The Lord,My Soul To Keep,And If I Should Die,Before I Wake,I Pray To The Lord,My Soul To Take,For Goodness Sake,Yeah And Everytime I See The Sunshine,I Drop Down And Give Thanks At Least One Time,Feellin Like Im Living On The Front Line,Im Feeling Like Every Second Is Crunch Time,I've Had Breakfast, Will I Make It To Lunchtime?,And I Ain't Joking, So Dont Be Looking For Punchlines,Will I Be The Next Victim Of A Gun Crime,I Dont Know The Answer, Thats Why I Brung Mine,Riding By Myself Late At Night,Pistol On My Lap At Every Single Red Light,Yeah I Made My Bed Right, So When I Do I Should Sleep Tight,In Peace I Rest,(Chorus: x2),Before I Sleep I Pray To The Lord,A Soul To Keep,And If I Should Die,Before I Wake,I Pray To The Lord,My Soul To Take,For Goodness Sake,Bury Me A Gangster Cause Thats What I Live,Dont Cry For Me I Gave The Best I Could Give,I Can Only Do Me, So Thats What I Did,And I Cherish Every Breath Of My Kid,And I Dont Wanna Go Before She Grow, That Aint Cool,But In This Game Of Life I Dont Make The Rules,Shit, So Thats Why I Get Twisted,So I Cant Feel It When It Hits Me,And My Moms Dont Need That On Her,But I See Death Around The Corner,And If He, So Happens To Make His Way Around The Block,You Gotta Answer The Door When He Knock,Believe That,(Chorus: x2),Before I Sleep I Pray To The Lord,A Soul To Keep,And If I Should Die,Before I Wake,I Pray To The Lord,My Soul To Take,For Goodness Sake,(Music Fade)

,Lil Wayne,"Baby understand me now,If sometimes you see that I'm mad,Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel,When everything goes wrong, you see some bad,But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good,O lord please don't let me be misunderstood,Misunderstood ain't gotta be explained,But you don't understand me so let me explain,Stood in the heat, the flames, the snow,Please slow down hurricane,The wind blow, my dreads swang,He had hair like wool, like wayne,Dropping ashes in the bible,I shake em out and they fall on the rifle,Scary, hail mary no tale fairy,All real very, extraordinary,Perry mason facing, the barrel if he tattle,My God is my judge, no gown no gavel,A hound, a rebel, down to battle,Now or never, I would never, in the ever,Fucking fantastic, fuck if you agree,I'm bright but I don't give a fuck if you see me,I'm just a soul whose intentions are good,O lord please don't let me be misunderstood,What's understood ain't gotta be explained,So for those who understand meet Dwayne,For 8 and a half months I gave ms. cit da pain,Now it's young money baby, keep the change,My mama say fuck em and we the same,So hello mothafucka you got some sheets to change,And ain't it funny how people change like easter sunday,You know church fit then outfit,,Bright pink and green chest look house lit,Bright pinky rings but that ain't about this,What you bout bitch,Excuse my french emotion in my passion,But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion,What are you asking, if I don't have the answer,It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula,But I know you don't understand, cause you thought lil wayne is weezy,But Weezy is Wayne,I'm just a soul whose intentions are good,O lord please don't let me be misunderstood,I was watching t.v. the other day right,Got this white guy up there talking about black guys,Talking about how young black guys are targeted,Targeted by who? america,You see one in every 100 americans are locked up,One in every 9 black americans are locked up,And see what the white guy was trying to stress was that,The money we spend on sending a mothafucka to jail,A young mothafucka to jail,Would be less to send his or her young ass to college,See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that,Our jails are populated with drug dealers, you know crack/cocaine stuff like that,Meaning due to the laws we have on crack/cocaine and regular cocaine,Police are only, I don't say only right, but shit,Only logic by riding around in the hood all day,And not in the suburbs,Because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood,And you know the other thing is mostly found in you know where I'm going,But why bring a mothafucka to jail if it's not gon stand up in court,Cause this drug ain't that drug, you know level 3, level 4 drug, shit like that,I guess it's all a misunderstanding,I sit back and think, well shit us young muthafuckas, you know that 1 in 9,We probably only selling the crack cocaine because we in the hood,And it's not like in the suburbs, we don't have what you have,Why? I really don't wanna know the answer,I guess we just misunderstood huh,You know we don't have room in the jail now for the real mothafuckas, the real criminals,WRONG: Sex offenders, rapists serial killers,RIGHT: Sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that,Don't get scared, don't get scared,I know you saw one of them sex offenders papers,Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, um hum,Yea that nigga live right down the street from you,Sex offender, on the level 3 drug, convicted, ex con, yea, check him out,And what you got? You got a daughter, son, what you got?,Yea, but you know what, you know what,I have a fucking daughter you understand me,,And why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail,Just because the reason why he live next door to me,Ain't the reason why I live next door to him,Meaning, he didn't rap his way to my fucking neighborhood,He sold crack/cocaine to get to my neighborhood,You move him out, bring him to jail for life,,And then you move in the sex offender,They give me a paper,Is that a misunderstanding cause I don't understand it,Another thing, let me take my glasses off,Because I wanna see the reaction on the faces when I say this,Uh, mr al sharpton,Heres why I don't respect you, and nobody likes you,See, your the type that's gets off on getting on other people,That's not good, no homo,And rather unhuman I should say,I mean, given the fact that humanity, well good humanity rather, to me,Is helping one another no matter your color or race,But this guy, and people like him,They rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word,You know spec before check,Anyway, id much rather you talk to me first,And see if you can lend an opinion before you make one,Just my thought of good humanity mr sharpton,Hold on, I ain't finished with you man,I gotta pluck the ashes, hold on,Um, mr sharpton, and anyone like you,You don't know me so if your not gonna try to,Then what you say or think about me or what I do,Is totally casper the friendly ghost to me,And it doesnt make you a good person to criticize before you improvise,Doesnt necessarily make you a bad person either but,The characteristics fall heavenly into bads way,But since I am human, I am good and bad as well,But I try my hardest to stay good,And some of the things I do and say may be bad or just not too good but I do try,So with that said, I don't fault you,I mean your only human, good or bad,But I also don't respect you and I don't care if that's good or bad,You see, you are no MLK, you are no Jessie Jackson, your a nobody, to me,Your just another don king, with a perm,Just a little more political, and that just mean your a little unhuman than us humans,And now let me be a human by saying fuck al sharpton and anyone like him,Fuck if you understand me I love being misunderstood,Why? cause I live in the suburbs but I grew up in the hood,Bring the hook in,I'm just a soul whose intentions are good,O lord please don't let me be misunderstood

'Cause if I watch you go, You'll see me wasting, you'll see me wasting away 'Cause today, you walked out of my life 'Cause today, your words felt like a knife I'm not living this life. Goodbyes are meant for lonely people standing in the rain And no matter where I go it's always pouring all the same. These streets are filled with memories Both good for detected pain And all I wanna do is love you But I'm the only one to blame. 'Cause today, you walked out of my life 'Cause today, your words felt like a knife I'm not living this life. But what do I know, if you're leaving All you did was stop the bleeding. But these scars will stay forever, These scars will stay forever And these words have no meaning If we cannot find the feeling That we held on to together Try your hardest to remember

Smoking on that “oh yeah”,My niggas tote that hardware,What you bout woadie?,My niggas about that warfare,Real nigga since day one,Cause I ain’t promised day two,Throw that pussy at me,Bitch, I think I’m Babe Ruth,Drop top Maybach on the way,Yeah that’s that new Land-o-Lakes,She hit me with her jungle,I’m gonna hit her with that rattle snake,Guns clap like patty cake,Blood gang red bandana face,Make them pussies pop theyself,You can call that “masturbate”,I don’t front no fabricate,I get high, I gravitate,Weezy F Baby bitch,The F is for Fascinate,Louisiana from that swamp,I’mma pull this bitch out and dump,Better run like Forrest Gump,Fuck you and where you from,3-2 I am the one: job well done,I ball 24/7, 3 6 5, 12 months,Put some redbone, put some caramel,Come to Wayne’s World, it’s a fairy tale,Yeah I’m high bitch, bitch I para-sail,Carter 4 is late, sorry for the wait.
