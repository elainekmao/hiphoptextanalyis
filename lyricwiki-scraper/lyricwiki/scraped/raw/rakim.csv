It came,In the form of a thug in the game,To create a strong position, there's blood in my vein,The chemical is identical, we one and the same,With seven letters in all three of my government names,Walk on water? Nah, neither did Jesus,Its a parable to make followers and readers believers,From Egypt to Budapest, Rakim is the truest left,Understand the Scriptures like the minister Louis F,I told you who God is, you ignored me like most the prophets,Jesus, Solomon, Abraham, Moses and Muhammad,I showed the scholars, we'll fulfill the broken promise,I spit this truth to predict the future like Nostradamus,Like Revelations, I'm hoping my quotes reveal,The seven spirits of God when I open the seal,Interpret the holy Quran, these flows will guide you,Translate the Torah, and decode the Bible,Warn the elders in the mosques, masons, and the law,The seven churches, the synagogues, it's the Renaissance,Skin is bronze, like the Messiah,Rakim Allah's 'bout to reveal a bigger secret than time and the God,Holy are you,Holy are you,There is no God but you (I want to challenge you),There is no God but you (and soon I will challenge the talents of the Lord),Praised be the Lord (I, I am the Alpha and Omega),Rakim Allah ,Peace

",Rakim:Skit
,Rakim,"What, uhh, yo,Just when things seemed the same, and the whole scene is lame,I come and reign with the unexplained for the brains till things change,They strain to slang sling, I'm trained to bring game,History that I arranged been regained by King James,Go to practice, with tactics, when the track hits, theatrics,Women that look like actress the status of Cleopatra's,Stacks of mathematics took the ?ego-a-geatics?,As I find out, what the facts is, for geographic,No time to sip Mo's with hostess, never mind what the total gross is,I rip shows, stay focused, and split cheese, with soldiers,While you hit trees and coast I spit flows that be ferocious,And with these explosives, I split seas for Moses,Shine permanently only my mind's concernin me,Fire burns in me eternally time's eternity,Followers turn on me they'll be in a mental infirmary,Determinely advance technology better than Germany,Since the first days you know of, till the last days is over,I was always the flow-er, I made waves for Noah,From a compound, to the anatomy, to the breakdown of a atom,Some of my rap patterns, still surround Saturn,From the ancient Hieroglyphics, to graffiti painted pictures,I study I know the scriptures but nowaday ain't it vicious,Date back I go beyond check the holy Qu'ran,To speeches at the altar on, now we get our party on,So being benificent, I bless em with dialogue,They expectin, the next testament by the God,I blow em through battlezones with chrome for chaperone,Blast beats with saxophones one of the baddest rapper's known,Every country city and borough, sidestreet and ghetto,isle and alley and meadow theories ferile enough to echo,When it was one mass of land, with one nash' of man,And the whole mass was ran under one master plan,Since the world's metamorphis, and the plan is kept in orbit,Turntables we spin off but the needles never skip off it,Rhythms we expressin similar to our ancestors,It'll answer your questions if you understand the message,From the days of the slave choppers?, to the new age of prophets,As heavy as hip-hop is I'm always ready to drop it,from the mind which is one of Allah's best designs,And mines'll stand the test of time, when I rhyme,The 18th Letter, the prophesy professor,I stay clever, long as the planet stay together,Bring up praise from Mecca, make a phrase for the better,In new days to remember, always and forever,(repeat 2X),The R baby

",Rakim:The 18th Letter (Always And Forever)
,Rakim,"[Rakim],Aiyyo.. what's goin on?,The Mic Lebanon Teflon Don..,I'm back baby,The year of the 9's,and I'ma have to make these motherfuckers a offer they can't refuse,Y'know?,Ha, what's goin on?  Yo c'mon, you know it's on,I wrote a song, test my flow on the Autobahn,Make sure the force is right, I floss all night,Get off the mic it'll smoke like an exhaust pipe,Keep em in the lie-bury, studyin my theory,Ra theory get translated in Swahili,From the lands as far as Zanzibar,they understand the R, the man Allah,It's obvious why the copiers, they copy this,soon as my data processes Y2K they floppy disk,Now who the hottest is?  How can it not be this?,Baby who the cockiest?  Papi is?  Gracias,Aiyyo, this be so, magnifico,Even my, typical, style difficult,Make a crowd go wild when I rip a show,Better stand back, this'll blow, you didn't know?,Chorus: Rakim,They show me love when I'm come through,Yo any club that I come to,I hit a microphone check one two,and they know what I wanna do - flow forever,[Rakim],You ever witness rapport like this before?,It's cause y'all kiss the floor, say this my Lord,It's the chosen one, with the golden tongue,Flow for the old and young when I'm holdin one,In the front row sitty, we show no pity,where kids get jiggy and girls are so pretty,The Wanderer, back from Casablanca,to stomp all, what next for Ra the Conqueror,So let's go, the best show will explode,No dress codes, they just pose in they best clothes,Girls get exposed when I show my rap expo,Will there be a next episode?  I guess so,Those that halved out, wanted to have clout,What they mad about?  Must be a cash route,MC's switch they style from they last bout,and I bet soon as they hear this they spaz out,Chorus 2X,[Rakim],Wherever Rakim go, it's the God temple,It's simple, my M.O., no problemo,Been all over the map, even know where Hell is at,I did the welcome mat, and then welcome back,My flow is raw, they treat me like Mr. Know-it-All,They want me to show em all my brand new protocol,Excuse-a-moi, I make a move for Ra,You ain't soupin Ra, save the hoop-a-la,Let me find out you rhymed out designed out,Pullin dimes out then climb out, for time out,I'm at the free throw, playin ball, or cee-lo, I keep dough,Reloaded like Carlito, incognito,I be so, low key, women get nosy,I do a show they wanna go see to get to know me,in the front row seat they cosy,thinkin I'm givin them the bo-bo-bee until they O.D.,Chorus 4X
