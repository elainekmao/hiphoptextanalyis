,The Notorious B.I.G.,"( Verse 1 ) ( Eminem ),It has been said, that there has been known to be blood shed,Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead,Strapped to beds, bite bombs dynamite lead,Money, power, respect, street cred, yeah,It's scary aint it? Picture yourself going out as a hero,Picth a Mural, pictures of us painted all over street corners,Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners,Notorious tried to warn us,So many piggy bank off of, Biggie's back and Pac's,Landmarks, history in rap, statistically in fact,It's so sad to see us re-enact,These tragic events, which lead us back,To where we left of March 9th to come from such hard knock life's,And make it out of the bottom to hit the spotlights,Once the artist, this is our lives,Cast out for all eyes,And he who lasts the longest must be the strongest,In this concrete jungle,Where this dog eat dog mentality comes from,This origin, which is usually originated from cats are starving,Or it could just be somebody's aura that just horrifies,And applies to his persona or the sizes in his entourage,That intimidates the people to the point,You know that he's gangster, he aint gotta say shit you just believe it,( Verse 2 ) ( Obie Trice ),Since Big taught us niggas to think big,I'm been about my business since then so it aint Cheers,It aint how we live, it's what he said he did it for Brooklyn,This I took in, sent chills through my skin,Vicious, I've experienced in the same sights as him,It's what excited Obie to write these poems,Rolling, going through the same shit he spoken,Open up my eyes there's no limit in them skies,When Ready 2 Die was a sick part of my life,Pummin that .45, plotting to pop my mind,Then that crooked eye Jamaican, I'd so many times Rewind,Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind,Get up out the system, who could give him better signs?,No pop of mine could top Big Poppas rhymes,So possibly I'd be popular huh?,That's the inspiration I got from my nigga P.I,( Verse 3 ) ( P Diddy ),I took a coal, a diamond, I moulded his mind, enter,The most phenomenal artist of any and all time,I made a Frankenstein, my designs impressed,Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess,Critics lash, said I made a fortune of his past an',All is did was build a dynasty off of his passion,And I'm addressing the adolesence absent to who he is,The original king of New York Christopher Wallace,This is a promise on Diddy's honor,I'm a father to ya'll and teach ya with all the drama,Don't even bother, or repeat,All of your albums play back to back,And I visit your grave cause our friendships intact,An ammaculate concept, extravagant progress,Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yelling God bless,Regardless to critics yelling that 'east-west',I seen the game loosing, I'm just pressing the reset,When the ressurection of you shines through an individual,Lyrical enough, doing the same crown of thorns literally,I'ma pay homage, brooklyns finest,Wether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, ni99a!

Yeah,Yeah, dedicatin' this to you, man,My man 50 Gran' told me straight up and down, man,I ain't 'sposed to love no ho, know what I'm saying?,I tried to tell her 50, I got three rules in life,I'm not to be played with, played on or played out,I'ma drop it like dis,Lyin' in my bed, I'm lookin' at four walls,Echo in my head sayin' I got a lot of gall,Grippin' my cap, my pen in my teeth,Thinkin' what this ho said, she called me a thief,She said I stole her heart and didn't leave a trace,I told her I was sorry and she said get out my face,Walked out my door with my walkman and my pocket,Playin', ""Love is a house"" and thinkin' how she jocked it,When she had the key to open up my door,Adore that prince scam that got me on the floor,I know that she loves me, I couldn't ever fake it,I say go buy a pie, the girl would go bake it,Makin' a record was important to me,More important than her, that's what made her flee,See, the mistake was not payin' no mind,All her posse said we was two of a kind,I called her back twice, your sister said you're broke,She said when you left your ears was full of smoke,Chokin' on a cigarette you don't even smoke,Jumped in the train station put in a token,Coulda been my partner, my amigo, my peer,Just waitin' for them three words that all girls wanna hear,I love you, huh you would start to cry,If I would reply with I L Y,Then I tell your friends that you played me out,Said I wouldn't say I love you just to make you shout,So I call up seven digits that would pick up your phone,Your sister picked it up and said that you wasn't home,I heard you in the back cryin' up a storm,Screamin' how you wish that I never was born,I hate him, I hate him that's what she kept sayin',She'll come to her senses is what I kept prayin',But now I'm gonna lay the cards on the line,Just say that you hate me or say that you're mine,I said when I played ball you was in the stands,When I was sick you held my hand,It was hard to say before but now I can,Bitch, I love no ho, fuck ya,I don't give a fuck about 'cha,Take a long walk off a short peer, bitch,Tryin' to take bankrolls,Bum bitches outta here, 50 man, now check it,Come to my crib, she say BIG listen,I don't like the way you been dissin',Feel like I been kissin' other bitches 'cause my lips feel chapped,I tell you it's from the blunts, you ain't tryin' to hear that,Now I'm Henny'd like a fuck, what's the riff?,Who I'm sleepin' with? I ain't got the time,To shoot the gift to hoes, I'm tryin' to take bankroll,I ain't fuckin' nobody, case closed,You hit the lights and decide to doze off,No kiss goodnight, didn't take your clothes off,And my dick is harder than a rock,Nobody to cock block but you's a hard rock,The fuck you think I am, gay?,I ain't got no time to play, I ain't got nuttin' to say,Bounce out the crib just to see my man 50,And what's up with BIG and the OGB,You know they keep plenty hookers,And I ain't a bad looker,So I see one ho that I like yeah, ooh,Shit is cool,Trust no hoes, all they want is bankroll,That's what I'm tryin' to tell you now, baby,My man 50 done schooled me to all y'all hookers,Ya know what I'm sayin'?
