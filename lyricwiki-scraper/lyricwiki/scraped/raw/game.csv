Bet the S-5 pink on it,Real niggas stand up, hold they dick,Bitch niggas sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?,I'm the type to pack a gat or few,Pull out and pop, simply 'cause I'm mad at you,Real niggas stand up, hold they dick,Bitch niggas sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?,I'm the type to pack a gat or few,Pull out and pop, simply 'cause I'm mad at you

Dep,Tryin to read my whole script, but ain't seen the movie yet,Better have that glock stuffed tonight,I'm comin through with Young Noble, and we, gon', make, it,A block bust tonight,(Chorus 2X: The Game),Getting American Money Easy, all I know,The Gangsta All Motherfuckers Envy, all my dough,It's a West coast knot, watch, let it bang out,Shots range out, for all the gangsta hangouts,(The Game),Lace your tips, polish your gators, we like odds in Vegas,You can't ball? Then it's probably the haters,Can't breathe then it's probably the Desert, if you a gangsta or not,I give a fuck dog, bullets is hot,And every nigga gon' cry when he hit, the more pain,The more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit,And your niggaz ain't gon' ride for shit, they know,If they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit,Red rag or blue rag, niggaz die for this,The Game the reason all these niggaz on that ""Cali Love"" shit,Compton niggaz get grimy too, pull you out of that 6,Fuck you up like one time'll do,And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard,Comin hard, Doogie Howser pullin bullets out your jaw,Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket,You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it,(Chorus),(Young Noble),Aiyyo, we left a stain on your block, you came with a cop,Pointin fingers at them niggaz, that kept shit hot,Next to 'Pac, I'm the hottest thang out, homey we can bang out,Outlaw air it out, box 'em in, square it out,Learn about your whereabouts and we right there,Me and Game have you left right there,N-O-B-L-E, O-U-T-L-A-W-Z,We bubble with ease, and I double my cheese,I got niggaz out in Compton that'll find yo' ass,I got niggaz out in Jersey, that'll hide yo' ass,For a long time if you ever fuckin with mine,It's a thin line dog between the real and the fraud,We killin your squad, my homeboy still in the yard,You the type of motherfcuker standin next to the God,The Game is deep, you motherfuckers ain't the streets,Young Noble and the homey Game flamin heat, c'mon,(Chorus)

When I'm just the new cat,That was taught if a ***** take shots to shoot back,Defending his yard, yeah standing his ground,I'm saying if you gonna retire, then hand me the crown,Nah, let Bleek do it, then throw him a concert in Madison square,Watch everybody sleep through it,We can go bar for bar, I'll let the lines speak to 'em,What they say?

",Game:300 Bars & Running
,Game,"(INTRO),My mama took me to Sam Goody's,I wanted to buy a 50 Cent CD,I took that shit home,That shit was wack like a muthaf**ka,Don't f**k with Game,I like 50 Cent,He reminds me Spongebob,And Tony Yayo is Blues Clues,And Lloyd Banks is Dora the Explorer,They're my friends,Psyche,I went down one of them Bodaga shits right there in Harlem,Got me a bootleg Lloyd Banks and Young Buck CD,Took that shit home, put it in my boom box,Thought I was bout to be on some radio Raheim shit,Man that shit sound like some Vanessa Williams '88,I mean Olivia cute but they say that bitch a man,So this Black Wallstreet for life now,GGG-UNOT!,(GAME),300 Bars and Runnin,Just loan me your ears for 15 minutes,Walk with me,Here the breakdown, pass the doja, .45 in the holster,Hollow tips'll fold 'em, them *****z they toy soldiers,Oh, that boy colder than Hova unless he sober,Like I'm the president, but this ain't the takeover,Now, there's the speaker, bring your ears a little closer,Before you call this a diss, and you make Hova pissed,Why would I wanna do that? When I'm just the new cat,That was taught if a ***** take shots to shoot back,Defending his yard, yeah standing his ground,I'm saying if you gonna retire, then hand me the crown,Nah, let Bleek do it, then throw him a concert in Madison square,Watch everybody sleep through it,We can go bar for bar, I'll let the lines speak to 'em,What they say? Bleek is over let Chris and Neef do it,They say the wrong thing, I'ma smack 'em silly,What you thought? Them was the only *****z that rapped in Philly?,See them *****z with the soonies leave you wrapped in Philly,Then dash in groups like Beanie Mac in Philly,?? said Curtis Jack in Philly,Make a U-turn, I gotta go back to Philly,I forgot my cheese stake, that's what I told the cops,So they wouldn't get the dogs start searching for the glock,And I can't forget, B.I.G. got murdered by the cops,Even I was Ready To Die, when I heard that he was shot,What's beef? Beef is when I murk you on the spot,Labels signing many things, still searching for they Pac,I put purple on the block,So I don't feel threatened when Ludacris say he coming for the #1 spot,Ask 50, it get lonely on top,You can hate me or love me, but now the cops the only homies he got,When it's beef we eat, we win, but we ain't lonely we pop,You sell records but a GGG-u not!,Acting big on the radio, to me you not,You can ask Mr. CCC who hot,Tony Yayo I bet 10 G's you flop,Run up on that new 300 C you got,Stop hoping I fall, hope the bleeding stop,And I hope you black out before you see the cops,I ain't hot top for colors, I'm from Cedar Block,So I got my hot tops that make your breathing stop,I'm a gangsta slash rapper, check your CD shop,I'm like Elvis in there, they can't believe you dropped,Now I'm moving on up to George and Weezy's spot,I picked up where my homeboy Eazy stopped,I saw the west coast, put the shit on my back,Sprayed Aftermath on it, then loosened the strap,It get hot in here, let Lucifer rap,Bring hell to *****z when Dre producing a track,Take it to the streets, put the duece duece to your hat,Then call up the pigs, tell them the rooster's back,Call Jadakiss, tell him that duke is back,I'm still by your side, no matter who comes strapped,F**k Lloyd Banks, it ain't about who can rap,It's about when the ?? clap, is rufus back,I see what you thinkin, you want me to die, is that so?,Now you left leaning back, thanks to Fat Joe,We got reservations in heaven, you ready? Let's go,Drop them off, then pop cristal wit Esko,I'm a say he hit me first, if me and Dre talk,All Nas said back was he had a ??,Now that's the eulogy, beef is kinda foolish see,*****z running their mouth about what the f**k they gon' do to me,But quit the yapping before I proceed to clapping,And you gon' see the captain with plans of getting me captured,Even behind bars, I'm still gon' shine,I'm 10 years younger than Yayo, I get out, I'm fine,Then I go right back, ***** I pop mines,How you gon' drop Olivia, you only drop dimes,I knew you changed, when you started sleeping in that vest dog,I don't need 50 Cent, my *****z make collect calls,1-800-split a faggot ***** wig,He got G-Unit wings, throw them off the Queens Bridge,Now your career is over, career is over,We in QB, banging CNN in the rover,T-O-N-Y, that's the phony NORE,You ain't the talk of New York, your sixteens is boring,Take that shit off lingo, go back to PC,And tell 50 Cent you want a copy of Beef 3,I'm airing their ass out on DVD,You wanna rhyme like Lloyd Banks repeat after me,I'm a G-Unit toy soldier,On Sesame street doing voice overs,Bitch ass ***** need a rhyme dictionary, to rehearse his lines,Sound like Oscar the Grouch, with them nursery rhymes,We was in the studio, when I first got signed,He got stuck, he called 50 tryna borrow some lines,That's the wrong *****, when you need help with your rhymes,All he gon' tell you is say G-Unit one more time,Got mad 'cause I ain't wanna make your beef mine,You got lucky with Ja, why you aint go at Shyne?,He freestyled from the pen, that's just the fact,Said he'd put you with your mom, and you ain't f**ked with that,Then you lied about your pops, he ain't never bust no cap,Like Father, Like Son, go ask Busta that,I knew from the beginning I couldn't trust those cats,I'd kill 'em all, if I could bring Justo back,The underground is mine, I treat it like home,It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones,The underground is mine, I treat it like home,It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones,The underground is mine, I treat it like home,It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones,I said,The underground is mine, I treat it like home,It's the reason *****z saying my name like Mike Jones,And I'm far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it,Do whatever to it, but it in the store the shit moving,Gave 'em a hundred bars, they ain't think I could do it,Came with two hundred, ***** this is more than music,Even Dre knew it, that boy hot like summer,Both feet in the dirt, 300 Bars and Runnin,And I beef with any *****, say my name muthaf**k I'm gunnin',You can put it on skee if you want it,I'll air you out on Drama King, Mike, or Clue,And watch them shits sell out like a Air Jordon shoe,I told Funk Flex when I catch the ***** Whoo Kid,We gon' see if he know how to DJ with bruised ribs,Don't hit me on the sidekick asking what you did,Get a gun or ask 50's police to use his,'cause Bloods gonna get ya,Bloods, Bloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain,That 380 spill brains, when I pop shots,Outside NY, in front of hip-hop cops,Or broad day in L.A., I'ma tell Em and Dre,This ***** bootlegging my music, ain't nothing for him to say,Took me off my own songs, then put it on his tapes,So I'ma take him out his house, put the beam on his face,Drop him off at Terror Squad, let him scream for the jakes,'cause when you f**king with Jayceon, you can bleed in the lake,For caking off *****z on them CD's and tapes,Ask them to scratch a record, you will see he fake,If 50 was Puffy, you'd run and go get him a cheese cake,Take the DJ off your name, Mr. Instant replay,Not the instant replay,I mean the machine that G-Unit use every time 50 on stage singing like,Bitches only feel your shit just a lil bit,*****z only feel your shit just a lil bit,On my album 50 helped me just a lil bit,Only on two songs, now back to some killa shit,My clips bananas, I kill a gorilla quick,Beating on your chest, I see to your death, yep,Tell Ecko to make him a suit,Tell Reebock to make him some boots,Get him a head band, to cover the holes in his head,He a dead man for thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman,Banks blacked out and let the gun blam without a M-E-T-H-O-D Man,So the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings,Take my advice, never wear air max for the ??,Unless you one of the Bloods, or a latin king,'cause if your left with the Aryans your ass will sting,And your cell mate is a 25 to lifer,They'll stab you an foursome then f**k you on Rikers,And Life Goes On,Now back to the coward of the hour who lied and said he write my songs,He told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf,So he gave me all his hits, you should've kept them for yourself,***** stop acting tough before I stand over you,Show you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre,Make a move I'm blasting your ass to the last one,Ten shots from the Mack empty the rest in the passenger,Fase yelling thats enough, let the coroner bag him up,Throw in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum,Gun smoking, Fase think I'm locin' backing up,Reverse the '05 hurse on 41st and traffic, what,Hip-Hop cops on my left, but I pass 'em up,The Dodge got a hemmy in it, Game got a Remy in 'em,In and out of lanes like a New York cab,I'm Mr. Ol' King, that New York cab,Who's this fake *****, on pictures with the Jake *****?,Got his crew starving 'cause he aint the whole cake, *****,He ain't Nas, ain't B.I.G., ain't Jigga,If he ain't Cube or Pac then who you got?,We getting tired of you talkin about who you shot,I'll use another six bars to tell you who you not,You ain't 50 Cent, he went out like a gangsta,You went out with Vivica, three months after wanksta,Get Rich or Die Tryin, we thought you was hot,Now the same ***** wanna take us to the Candy Shop,C'mon man, what happened to the thug?,Now you could find in the club, him and Lloyd Banks hugging,***** got mad when The Game start buzzing,So f**k making friends now I'm into throwing slugs,Olivia talking about we a family, Game had to go,***** I'll smack that ho like I'm Jackie-O,'cause I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be you,I don't wanna shake hands, or wear your G-Unit shoes,Don't want you on my hooks, don't wanna be in your group,Just wanna sit here and wait,To be gone, so I can head back to the block,Fresh white Nike airs and the matching socks fitted,Pull the brim low, if they don't get it,Bentley Coup on gold daytons, I was the first one with it,Four times platinum, I done been there and did it,Came in the game and shitted, then wiped my ass with it,They say the Lord givth, if Lord take it away,So I build a house on top of Hip-Hop, I'll wait for the day,*****z hating on me, they don't want Jayceon to play,And the DA waiting on Jayceon to make a mistake,So they can put me in the SWAT car and lock me away,Give me a odd job in the pen for minimum pay,Let me out so I can drive down criminal way,Pushing the rock, nah this ain't no subliminal Jay,The summer too hot, and I want the winter to stay,'cause I'm a cold ***** when I put the pen to the page,Similar to them shells going into my gauge,I hand 'em off to Dre, he turned them into granades,And Just Blaze, 'cause the boy got game,Like I close my eyes, and woke up in a Roc chain,Now back to reality, my gun and my vest,And if diamonds are forever, then I'm Kanye West,Take a look at my chest, a hundred thou wet jacob,Whole crew got chains, a hundred thou can't break 'em,And the flow is hot like that wit Satan,And the only thing I got spinning is Daytons,The hotter I get the more willing to snake 'em,So soon as the beat drop, watch where I take 'em,Compton Swap meet, to get me some All-Stars,When Game in the house, they call ??,'cause they heard about what went on in D.C.,Heard about Hot 97, my beef with 50,Now tell me do he got a conscience?,I think not, 'cause if he did I wouldn't be involved in this nonsense,Wouldn't be in Harlem, wouldn't be at this conference,I'd rather be pushing rock, like ??,50 whispered in my ear, like we still bonding,We ain't friends, I'm just acting like Charles Bronson,Middle finger in the air, one hand on my Johnson,Hip-Hop police on me like I'm the convict,What happened to the old school? I thought it was rhyming,Doug E. Fresh and Dana Day on the corner like Common,Now that ain't common, it's more like Top Ramen,The flow is news, I throw it up like vomit,And I still shine like diamonds,They kicked me out of G-Unit and I rebounded like Rodman,It's still Aftermath, two feet in the paint shit.,I be mad, I ain't, I'm supposed to stop I can't because,I'm in the hood politican, Impala liffin',And I keep a black .45 on the side of my prada denim,Chip on my shoulder like I'm fresh outta prison,Dollar vision, blow a hundred thou like my wallet missing,Then re-up like kid before the d-cup,Continuously getting money with my feet up,Chasing the throne, here my black Air Force,I said f**k Benzino and got the cover of The Source,Feel me?
