To The Extreme (1990),Vanilla Ice,"Yo, VIP, let's kick it,Ice Ice, baby,Ice Ice, baby,All right, stop, collaborate and listen,Ice is back with my brand new invention,Something grabs a hold of me tightly,Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly,Will it ever stop?,Yo, I don't know,Turn off the lights and I'll glow,To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal,Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle,Dance!,Bum rush the speaker that booms,I'm killin your brain like a poisonous mushroom,Deadly when I play a dope melody,Anything less than the best is a felony,Love it or leave it,You better gain way,You better hit bullseye, the kid don't play,If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it,Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it,Ice Ice, baby    ,Vanilla  (4X),Now that the party is jumping,With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumpin',Quick to the point, to the point no faking,I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon,Burning them if they're not quick and nimble,I go crazy when I hear a cymbal,And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo,I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo,Rollin' in my 5.0 with my ragtop down so my hair can blow,The girlies on standby,Waving just to say, ""hi,"",Did you stop? No, I just drove by,Kept on pursuing to the next stop,I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block,That block was dead, yo,So, I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue,Girls were hot, wearing less than bikinis,Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis,Jealous, 'cause I'm out getting mine,Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine,Ready for the chumps on the wall,The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight ball,Gunshots ranged out like a bell,I grabbed my nine--,All I heard were shells,Fallin' on the concrete real fast,Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas,Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed,I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack,Police on the scene, you know what I mean?,They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends,If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it,Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it,Ice Ice, baby    ,Vanilla  (4X),Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet,Miami's on the scene, just in case you didn't know it,My town that created all the bass sound,Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground,'Cause my style's like a chemical spill,Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel,Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept,We make it hype and you want to step with this,Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja,Cut like a razor blade,So fast, other DJs say, ""Damn"",If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram,Keep my composure when it's time to get loose,Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice,If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it,Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it.,Ice Ice, baby    ,Vanilla (4X),Ice,Yo man--let's get out of here!,Word to your mother!,Ice Ice, baby    ,Too cold,Ice Ice, baby    ,Too cold too cold (3X)

'Cause I'm afraid,Handcuffs and chains is a game I don't play,No doubt in my mind that the girlie is the boss,Stop this train 'cause I wanna get off,Stop that train, I wanna' get off,Stop that train, I wanna' get off,Later on that night as it got worse,My body's steamin' up and I was ready to burst,She had me hot as a skillet taken from a flame,And my admission was free for me to ride on this train,Yea, I must admit to myself, it was fun,But, now I'm lookin' for my shoes, I'm ready to run,So, now I'm hopin' and prayin' for the moment to come,'Cause I couldn't move and my body was numb,So, now what have I done to get myself into this?,It started from a kiss, now I'm ready to resist,I couldn't take it no more, on the bed, or the floor,My knees were gettin' weak and my back was gettin' sore,The room was destroyed, not to mention my body,Why did I ever tell her to ""Pump it, Hottie?"",What could I do to just ease the pain?,I think I'll let the hook try to explain,Stop that train, I wanna' get off,Stop that train, I wanna' get off,Stop that train, I wanna' get off,Stop that train, I wanna' get off
