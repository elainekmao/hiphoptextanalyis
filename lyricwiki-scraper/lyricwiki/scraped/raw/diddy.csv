Three niggaz dressed in black,Roleys on they wrist, feathers in they hat,One tapped me on my back, then pointed at my stack,Put my finger on the trigger,then I asked him, ""Whatchu want nigga?"",Chorus: Puff Daddy,Whatchu gonna do when it's your turn to go,Whatchu gonna do when you can't take no mo',You gonna cry like a bitch or take it nice and slow,Whatchu gonna do when it's your turn to go,(repeat 2X),Verse Two: Puff Daddy,I pray to God that I'm dreamin, I know my family,wouldn't take it, when the doctor said, ""He ain't make it"",Mom Dukes cryin, baby mom full of grief,How she gonna tell her son his daddy is deceased?,Now she got beef with them bitches up the street,All because I used to creep, with her girlfriend Sharese,She knows, I keep the hoes, from nation, to nation,On every radio station, Goodfellas in rotation, uhh,That's why niggaz wanna twist my shit, flip my wig,Attempt to murder me like Tommy Gills,Before they draw, niggaz threw me to the floor,Drill holes in my pocket, Sam launch the rocket,They wanna rip my arms out the socket, f**kin heathens,Love to see a nigga stop breathin,I heard a voice sing out, ""Ain't you Sean Puffy Combs?,Here's your eulogy, meet you at the Crossroads"",G'night Bone,Chorus,Verse Three: Puff Daddy,Nothing but clouds and white suits fill my vision,Watching my life go down, like Christian,Listen hear them bullets rang, shotguns and Mac millis,spraying like a hurricane in this war called the terror game,And deuce deuces can't stand the pain,Little guns ain't got no business in this blizzard,they just kibitz, here's five shots to visit, blaka,Blowin bullet holes sizes of door knockers,Three headed for my chest straight, the other two,came a little late, and just barely missed my face,I'm tryin to find a steady place between two cars,One of us gon' either wind up dead, or behind bars,Shit, I'm just tryin to live, so I can raise my kid,and own the world, bone all the girlie girls,That's when I finally figured out,That's that nigga David Arthur, Sharese baby father,And I didn't even bother to ask no further questions,No more confessions only suggestions,I think Sam set me up, cause them bullets squeezed up,from the rear, and Sam was the only nigga there,Then they all peeled out in the rental, aluminum,Sam in the passenger seat, so I'm assumin them,niggaz didn't even get to peep,Lil' Kim and them, in the backseat, with the heat,Clips they feelin em, to the top, shit ain't sweet,Once the light turns red, nuff said, that's dead,They fled, and they waved, hot lead,If I aimed up, I'd be on my deathbed,Sucker move, for that they don't get no props,Lil' Kim and them, mad they ain't bust no shots,We in the block, no Land posters just old posters,of gangsta niggaz I see ghosts of gangsta figures,I'm tryin to hold my own when they snatched me out the car,Took me in the saloon and said, ""Puffy, there you are"",Them same cats we chased two blocks had new spots,washin dishes, I guess for goin out like bitches,I smacked em, gave a little speech, to mirth,Happiness, cause me and all my peeps got hurt,That night, I said a little prayer, me and Justin,That's when I heard the bustin, yeah,Chorus

I can fill that void,When you spend time with your woman and listen,It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten,I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth,Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself,I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt,And prove to you you're more important than anything else,Worthwhile, special like my first child,When I see your face it's always like the first time,Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet,I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet,Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you,Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to,Let it be known, I told you,And i'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true,Repeat 1,[r. kelly],Don't let him sing you a sad song (no baby),Waiting for love like this too long,(you don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby),All that you need I can give you,(you don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on),I do, satisfy you,(you don't have to wait on him),[puffy],I'm the light when you can't see,I'm that air when you can't breathe,I'm that feeling when you can't leave,Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive,So it's only you and me,When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong,I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong,Keep you away from harm, my love is protected,I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected,I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare,In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared,Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you,Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you,Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil,Make love all night, bending bed coils,You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal,This is all for you, cause I simply adore you,Repeat 1 until fade,[puff],This one right here goes out to all my sisters

No Way Out (1997),Puff Daddy,"Then, there are the times in my life,When I feel, trapped,Feel there's, no way out,No escape,To be honest, I don't know where my life is goin,Where I'll end up at,I just don't know,Verse One: Puff Daddy,I looked back and saw the cat focus, took notice,Stayed away from the bogus, til his rise began,Phillies stacked his grand played the brokest,til he seemed hopeless, soon to be the dopest, cat comin,Track stunnin, fame singin, his name ringin,Money starts to pile, honeys start to wild,Top notch drop top make everything he drop hot,He dream, visualize, plot and scheme,Got the cream legally without the beam,Witcha fire eye drive slow, 8-5-0,Jet black tint still, they might know,Who the cat controllin the strings of rap and R&ampB,Trapped inside of a movie starrin me, so far,Chorus: repeat 2X,Do you know where you're,goin to?,Do you like the things that,life is showing you?,Where are you going to?,Do you know?,Verse Two: Puff Daddy,Shorty was brimmin, singin, hangin with cats who move bricks,Heard she do backflips, for niggaz who stack chips,Suck for dough, now she fuck for Bills up in Buffalo,Real G's makin her back swell,Only givin head to those niggaz who rapped well,Owned a black cell, flip it, sippin on Whitman cool mints,Rumors spread, half a G she took, six or more,Two bagged up, four went raw,Back of my mind countin up the big score,Violators from the door, she lookin up from the floor,Sore from all the pain her body couldn't ignore,So far from pure, rotten to the core,Either or, for sure, trapped inside the world of a whore,Chorus,Verse Three: Puff Daddy,Hard to cope with, all these niggaz and dope whips,with cash flow, motherfuckers that gotta flash gold,to bag hoes, they not nice, 600 circle the block twice,In they Roleys they rock ice, to get they hit on,Bitches dyin to get on, suck a dick or get shit on,Don't understand they playin wit it,Players get these bitches open and let they man hit it,Fuck that, you can trust that, if I had a gun,I'd release slugs black and bust back,See how these players love that, to the point where,I can't take it, I'm a playa hater, I can't fake it,I wanna spill myself, to feel the thrill myself,And since I can't be a player, wanna kill myself, trust,Chorus w/ variations,I been on this road for a long time now,At time it seems like the road is never gonna end,On this road there's a lotta, hills and mountains,Peaks and valleys,Even a lot of potholes on this road,It's never smooth, on the road of life,I don't know where I'm going,I just know where I wanna end up at,Chorus w/ variations,Lord can you help me get there?,Please let me get there,*piano interlude, Chorus again*
