,T.I.,"Now don't try to point fingers or laugh at a man who popped a million pills,Because i can come right back and make you frown since i got a stack of bills,I've been clean for 2 years and no thoughts of turning back,To the time period where i looked like a smoked crack,My girls are the only ones that matter ,So haters just quit the fuckin chatter ,Adrenaline rushing at another level,So cut the shit and stop competing with these pussy devils,Writers block took the most outta me,So im gunna release hell on this game undoubtedly,My ex turned lesbian so she no longer wants to fuck me ,Approach her abruptly so eat a motherfuckin pussy till u reach the point of gluttony,It ain't about the chains or the fame i never would of came in this game if it wasn't for the lifestyle,That i had wanted to hold a knife while havin anything i could ,No one is the same so i would never change if i could

pickin' the ho up,You bogus running out on your kids my nigga grow up,For God's sake, like a wedding, cutting large cake,For large stakes let the hammer bang broad day,Ay, nevermind what the blogs say,This what my mind and my heart say,My philosophy profit off of my properties,Get it, flip it, we got to be rich, that broke shit is obsolete,Possibly off of my rocker, watch how you watching me,Sophisticated, psychotic, fly as a pilot,Officially silent, all you wish you could get I got it,Unlimited titanium nigga, what's in yo wallet?,Out of gladiator college, I made it summa cum laude,While you clowns couldn't have got a cap and gown if you bought it,I parlay with Saudis, buying crude oil and diamonds,Hustle January, July, fly to Dubai,A broke nigga telling me 'bout how I'm dividing the pies,Like a blind nigga telling me it's an eye for an eye,Bullheaded and stubborn I be that way until I die,But find a nigga with more hustle than me I dare you to try,And according to the hand on my Audemar,It's my time to shine so fuck y'all,What should I be sorry for,Who should I be sorry to,What should I be sorry for,Who should I be sorry to,The fact is you can't please everybody,You can't please everybody,What should I be sorry for,Who should I be sorry to,I grew up in the gutter, life a motherfucker,I get that why I don't trust a motherfucker,Seen a nigga snitch on they mom, shoot at they brother,Go to prison in love with a bitch and a nigga fuck her,I seen real G's destroyed by real suckers,Innocent ladies raped and defenseless babies abducted,Such a horrible truth, but you see it over and over,It's nothing, you numb to it and your heart grow colder,Pacify your pain with a chain and a Rover,Fuck it, justify your action by stacking your dough up,You show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda,Just enough for me to blow up, nigga hold up,Switch the flow up, cause these niggas be snitchin' so much,I promise all they missing's the badge, coffee, and donut,Go to jail so what, never see my integrity perish,That ain't the Harris' way, study my pedigree,Promise I'm one of the only ones who keep it 100,Probably why I think they all out to get me, you can't convince me,Large money and fame will plant seeds of envy,To make my partners resent me enough to come and get me,Catch me slippin' and hit me, just like they did 50,Cause I'm in the position that he think he should be given,Listen, dawg, the fact of the matter is,I'm on a narrow path and we all can't travel,What should I be sorry for,Who should I be sorry to,What should I be sorry for,Who should I be sorry to,The fact is you can't please everybody,You can't please everybody,What should I be sorry for,Who should I be sorry to,What it ain't, what it is?,Even if you gotta live,I learned that apartment is way more exciting than a big ass house on a hill,I used to be a way better writer and a rapper,When I used to want a black Karmann Ghia,Now a nigga speeding in a Porsche,Feeling like I'm going off a course,Cut these fuck niggas off,Nigga Tip in my life, scream that till I'm hoarse,Duck these get the fuck off me projectiles,,Bitch you ain't really got a choice,I'm living my life live yours,I don't even like rapping fast, but that's how the word come to me,Talk to me sideways nigga that's your ass,Slow it down, this that shit that'll make you call your momma,Say hey I'm sorry for begging for all them clothes you couldn't afford,And this the type of shit that'll make you call your rap partner,And say I'm sorry I'm awkward, my fault for fuckin' up the tours,I hated all the attention so I ran from it,Fuck it if we did, but I hope we ain't lose no fans from it,I'm a grown-ass kid, you know ain't never cared about no damn money,Why do we try so hard to be stars, just to dodge comments,And this that shit that'll make you call your baby mama,When you gone on half a pill, don't know why but that I did,Then you take a flight back to the crib, y'all make love like college kids,And you say all the shit you gon' do better, we can try this shit again,'Round the time the dope wear off, you feel stupid, she feel lost,That's that dope, I mean, I mean dopamine you think Cupid done worn off,Waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed,Her baby boy face full of applesauce,Maybe should have stayed but it ain't yo fault,Too much pressure, I fell off, I'm sorry,Was young and had to choose between you,And what the rest of the world might offer me, shit what would you do,Well I'd probably do it differently if second the chance,Only if some cool ass older man would've let me know in advance,This, this quarry, that is dug so deep in a father's chest,When he feel that he's broken up his nest,And he figured shit he was just doing the best that he could,Which end up being the worst that he could,And all some pussy nigga on the internet can say is that verse ain't good,It's boring - boring?,Really?,When I'm disgusted with this world and I can hardly breathe and,Told so many lies, don't know what to believe,I discussed it with this girl, and this is what she said,She said lay down baby, baby, rest your weary head up,I love these distractions but my mind don't wanna rest,But my body disagree so I laid up on her breasts, yes,Ooh, you are so fucking fine,I woke up the next morning with new purpose on my mind,Ooh, who pulls your ponytail,Who knows your body well,What should I be sorry for?,Who should I be sorry to?

No Mercy (2010),"T.I.,Christina Aguilera","Everyone thinks that I have it all,But it's so empty living behind these castle walls,These castle walls,If I should tumble, if I should fall,Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls,There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls,Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in,Bet you would think I got it made, better look again,I got a butler, got a maid, and a mansion,The belief is that I'm living out a millionaires fantasy,With phantoms and Ferrari's in the driveway,But you see the pain and the change of the same man's sanity,Your vision jaded by the Grammy's on the mantelpiece,Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony,Apparently it's damaging the man you see before,You on the canvas he may seem alright but all the disadvantages,His family encounters overshadows his extravagance,Walk in my nines awhile I dare you, I scare you,While it really seem like the kings life seem glamorous,As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs,Because the camera's don't see beyond the walls of the smiles,Only counts until it falls in the pile,Everyone thinks that I have it all,But it's so empty living behind these castle walls,These castle walls,If I should tumble, if I should fall,Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls,There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls,Honestly to me, I think I'd lose every benefit,Of all that I've accomplished if my kids never win at shit,Me knowing this, why should the verses I have laid,Be more important to me than the persons I have raised,I guess I'm saying that to say that opportunity,But they just don't equate to all the time they take away,From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake,If Deyjah end up a stripper and Major out there slinging, yay,How could I ever consider myself a great,If Messiah ain't paid and Nique Nique ain't straight,Would your favourite song about the whips, money and shit,Be relevant if you found out, the money wasn't real, nope,So me being the goat shouldn't mean more to me,Than see it to a king though,From a bad ass kid to man with some dough,Otherwise I may well have stayed poor,So while they stay focused on me beefin with flip,,Shawty low, Gucci or Ludacris or if I'm fucking with a hoe,Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense,Internally I'm dealing with this conflict,So excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand,Or slap me in the face, ay, I'm just the man,If they saying I ain't the best at making hit records,It's cause this my life, these ain't just rapping,Shit, you think of that deep, did ya, dawg?,See you can't see the castle through the walls 'till it falls,Bitch ain't thinking with the deep, did ya dog?,Cause see you can't see the castle through the walls 'till it falls,Everyone thinks that I have it all,But it's so empty living behind these castle walls,These castle walls,If I should tumble if, I should fall,Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls,There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls,Nobody knows I'm all alone,Living in this castle made of stone,They say that money is freedom,But I feel trapped inside it all,And while I sit so high up on a throne,I wonder how I can feel this low,On top of the world it's beautiful,But there's no place to fall,For the record ay, I could give a damn if I never sell shit again,My career was meant for me to come and tell it,Honest interpretation of how affected I'm faced with,Matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement,The day that I walk I ain't saying that I'm amazing,Down playing the way I keep fellas from catching cases,Won't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying,And when I say what I mean even when I'm sorrounded by the fakers,From one of the greatest centers, blessed with most of god's graces,Who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places,So next time you rating royalty,,I'm always being given to recordings than the level of your loyalty,Obvious you've been ignoring me,Who else ya seen make it through the storm, unharmed this charming,While all the critics was looking for prince charming,Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt,Even though he made a castle out of used to be a house,He did shit that all your favorites rappers only rap about,But most of y'all don't see the castle through the walls,And the smiles 'till it falls in piles so while,Everyone thinks that I have it all,But it's so empty living behind these castle walls,These castle walls,If I should tumble, if I should fall,Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls,There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls
