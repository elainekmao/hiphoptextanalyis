Mine dog, of course it's real,Passin judgment, you niggaz second-guessin Beans,Cause you don't eat swine don't make you Amin,Dog you know a couple suras, out the Qur'an,I guess you all on your din and I ain't on mine,Stop that Akki, 'fore I send shots though your body,Make 'em feel feel hell on earth before Allah drop thee,I feel the line's drawn here, nuttin more can stop me,Till them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me,There's only three things that make Mac not act like Beans,Amatullah Tisha, Po Aldin, Samir Amin,My seeds dog, gotta teach 'em that before I leave dog,Shit I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave dog,I come back in the afterlife,Like fuck it I done touched hell twice; what's the meanin?,[Chorus],[Scarface],Yeah.. uhh..,Now as I walk into the studio, to do this with Jig',I got a phone call from one of my nigs,Said my homeboy Reek, he just lost one of his kids,And when I heard that I just broke into tears,And see in the second hand; you don't really know how this is,But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib,So I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news,Now we both depressed, countin our blessings cause Brad's two,Prayin for young souls to laugh atlife through the stars,Lovin your kids just like you was ours,And I'm hurtin for you dog; but ain't nobody pain is like yours,I just know that heaven'll open these doors,And ain't no bright side to losin lifel; but you can view it like this,God's got open hands homey, he in the midst.. of good company,Who loves all and hates not one,And one day you gon' be wit your son,I could've rapped about my hard times on this song,But heaven knows I woulda been wrong,I wouldn'ta been right, it wouldn'ta been love,It wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us,This can't be life,[Chorus],[Jay-Z],This can't be life..

,Jay-Z,"Yeah,Intro/Chorus: Jay-Z,I'm what the game made me,Not what the fame made me,No amount of money can change me,I'm what you lames can't be,Live nigga what?  Live as f**k,(repeat 2X),Verse One: Jay-Z,Check, live from the 7-1-8,Either respect the flow or learn your lesson from your weight,I'm wishin arthritis on all writers who, Knock My Hustle,How can y'all understand the struggle?,It's hard to live, when you got greedy niggaz in the mix,Knowin I outclass three-E niggaz in the six,So I outblast til it's empty clips,And I outlast niggaz, survival of the fit,One life, I gotta make sure it's done right,Cause them yet to have a conversation bout reincarnation,Ball out, until I fall out,Stick thick chicks, try to tear they wall out,Hard to think about your future with, nothin to gain,Hard to concentrate on school with stomach pain,Life's harsh, I know y'all runnin from 'caine,but it'll only catch you and track you down,With no deal, who you gonna rap to now?,Start your own record company, that's profound,Live niggaz gonna rumble when you back from the war,Jive niggaz gonna crumble and fall,Chorus,Verse Two: Memphis Bleek,Aiyyo whether in the Pinto, or rollin in the six,I come through cocky, holdin my dick,I never switch shit, cause that's some bitch shit,I get the Bisquick take it to the district,cause I could never get rich, and switch my style,I just cop a little hurt, to the mercantile,I'm tryin to get it though, rhymin with this six digit flow,Gettin fly is the minimal, holdin somethin is the principal,Respect this young nigga that's, holdin the torch,Preachin shit like the crack game, don't take shorts,Throw it down it's a bet, nigga roll hard,til you got somethin icey, round your neck,In this concrete jungle get rich or remain humble,Never speak the biz, at worst I might mumble,Niggaz test it I spit guns, angrily,Til all that remains is me,Chorus (by Memphis Bleek instead of Jay-Z),Verse Three: Sauce Money,I went from no dough to show dough to money to blow,From umm, hoe I don't know, to get deez,Never, ""Excuse me miss,"" bitch please, never try to provoke,Same disrespectful cat I was when I was broke,Ain't nuttin changed baby but the different faces I stop,or maybe some of the places I shop,Now that I run through tracks like cleets with a Air,for some of the hottest beats, still catch me eatin at Pete's,F**k the foul cat who screamed out and threatened my life,It's all good, here I come kid, dead to the hood,til I'm in the dirt, foul cats like termites,come out of the woodworks, if they think you stack paper,Dead niggaz react later while the cancer spread,Teach a team how to scheme before they answer lead,You know me, I used to shoot hoops in the park, ain't nothin changed,except now I push Coupe's in the dark,Chorus (Sauce Money instead of Jay-Z)

Hectic,Had to call upon my wolves to send, n*ggaz the message,I said this: Â´LetÂ´s play fair and we can stay here,IÂ´m trying to transform you Boyz II Men like daycareÂ´,Hey thereÂ´s money to be made and, n*ggaz got the picture,Stopped playing with my paper and, we got richer,Then hard times fell upon us, half of my staff,had warrants, the other half, in the casket lay dormant,I felt like life was cheating me, for the first time,in my life I was getting money but it was like my concious was eating me,Was this a lesson God teaching me? Was he saying that?,IÂ´m playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back,like bad coke, pimp or die, was my mindframe bad,Was n*ggaz thinkin simplify was turning cocaine crack?,AinÂ´t a whole lot of brain to that, just trying to maintain a stack,and knock a lot like two trains thatÂ´s on the same track,Â´Fore I get my life together like the oars I bring back,In the bottom of the pot where no, water gets hot,Got my transporter take it Â´cross the border then stop,Set up shop with a quarter of rock, hereÂ´s the plan,For three straight weeks, n*ggaz slaughtered the block,But you know the game is Â´lluted, f*cked up me and my dues,One drop can wipe a n*gga out, faster than the cops,and this unstable way of living just, had to stop,Half of my n*ggaz got time, we done real things,By ninety-four became the subject of half of yÂ´all n*ggaz rhymes,Public apoligies to the families of those caught up in my street,But thatÂ´s the life for us lost souls brought up in the streets,The life and times of a demonic mind, excited with crime,And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind,I figured, Â´Sh*t why risk myself I just write it in rhymes,And let you feel me, and if you donÂ´t like it then fineÂ´,The mindstate, of a n*gga who boosted the crime rate,so high in one city they send National Guards to get me,Ya dig?,The streets

The Life and Times of Shawn Carter (1999),Jay-Z,"[Jay-Z],Who ever thought young Shawn Carter would change the game?,Used to rap to the raindrops off my window pane,Duckin the plain cops, pushin indo and 'caine,At the kitchen table late night, no pen, just my brain,First album niggaz love me cause they thought I was poor,Guess I'm successful; industry don't love me no more,Well I'm the same nigga from your corner, bubblin raw,Skully tilted, pants saggin, damn near touchin the floor,And I come with do-rags to your so-called awards,T-shirt with my chain out like fuck y'all all,Retrospect ain't been the same since I lost my dad,He's still alive, but still fuck you, don't cross my path,A&R's had me feelin like moss in the drab,So I turned the league out with ""Reasonable Doubt"",Get your CD's out, let's go, song for song,I'm the illest nigga doin it til y'all prove me wrong,Do you believe?,It's Hova the God, uhh, uhh, uhh..

(me and my boyfriend),[Verse 2: Jay-Z],The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin,with the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin,Now they 'bout nothin - if ever you mad about somethin,It won't be that; oh no it won't be that,I don't be at, places where we comfy at,With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that,And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin this earth's surface is,But girlfriend, work with the kid,I keep you workin at Hermes, Burkin bag, ,Manolo Blahnik Timbs, aviator lens,600 drops, her-cedes Benz,The only time you wear Burberry to swim,And I don't have to worry, only worry is him,She do anything necessary for him,And I do anything necessary for her,so don't let the necessary occur, yep!,[Chorus],talk 2 em- B...,(beyonce),If I was your girlfriend,I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you,Even if that somebody teasin' was me,Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em B),Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be,And so I put this on my life,Nobody or nothing will ever come between us,And I promise I'll give my life,my love and my trust if you was my boyfriend,Put this on my life,The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in,I promise I'll give my life,my love and my trust if you was my boyfriend,[Chorus],2*Jacki3zBrad*28

Nah! got a connect? No!,Who under Heaven know how to be successful,Need a Personal Jesus, I'm in Depeche Mode,They say its celestial, its all in the stars,It's like Tony LaRussa,On how you play your cards,You all ain't fucking with me!,The ironies are,And at all costs better before he was bars,Now lets start, on your mark,Get set, lets go-get out the car!,Going in circles, its a vicious cycle,This is a crash course, this ain't high school,Wake up, Muttley, you're dreamin' again,Your own reality show, the season begins,[Chorus],Step One in this process, scramble up in your projects,And head to the heights where big coke is processed,You gotta convince 'em that you not from the Precinct,Please speak slow, cause he no speakey no English,If he takes a liking after a couple of trips,If your money is straight, he's gonna give you consignment,You're now in a game where only time can tell,Survive the droughts, i wish you well...,Survive the droughts? I wish you well?,How sick am i? I wish you HEALTH,I wish you wheels, i wish you wealth,I wish you insight so you could see for yourself,You could see the signs, when the jackets is schemin',And the cops is comin', you could read they mind,You could see from behind, you could redefine,The game as we know it, one dream at a time,I'm American dreamin',[Chorus]

There are an uncounted number of the dead tonight...,People are being forced to live like animals...,We are desperate...,No one says the federal government is doing a good job..,And hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people...,No water, I fought my country for years..,We need help, we really need help..,In Baghdad, they they drop, they air drop water, food to people..why cant they do that to their own people?,The same idiots that can't get water into a major American city in less than three days are trying to,win a war...,[Verse 1 - Jay-Z],People was poor before the hurricane came,But the down pour poured is like when Mary J. sang,Every day it rains, so every day the pain,But ignored them, and showed em the risk was to blame,For life is a chain, cause and effected,Niggas off the chain because they affected,It's a dirty game so whatever is effective,From weed to selling kane, gotta put that in effect,Wouldn't you loot, if you didn't have the loot?,Baby needed food and you stuck on the roof,Helicopter swooped down just to get a scoop,Through his telescopic lens but he didn't scoop you,The next five days, no help ensued,They called you a refugee because you seek refuge,The commander-in-chief just flew by,Did he stop? No, he had a couple seats,Just proved jet blue he's not,Jet flew by the spot,What if he ran out of jet fuel and just dropped,hu,That woulda been something to watch,Helicopters doing fly-bys to take a couple of shots,Couple of portraits then ignored 'em,He'd be just another bush surrounded by a couple orchids,Poor kids just 'cause they were poor kids,Left 'em on they porches same old story in New Orleans,Silly rappers, because we got a couple Porches,MTV stopped by to film our fortresses,We forget the unfortunate,Sure I ponied up a mill, but I didn't give my time,So in reality I didn't give a dime, or a damn,I just put my monies in the hands of the same people that left my people stranded,Nothin' but a bandit,Left them folks abandoned,Damn, that money that we gave was just a band-aid,Can't say we better off than we was before,In synopsis this is my minority report,Can't say we better off than we was before,In synopsis this is my minority report,[Verse 2 - Ne-Yo],So many times I'm, covering my eyes,Peeking through my fingers,Tryin' to hide my, frustration at the way that we treat,(Seems like we don't even care),Turn on the TV, seein' the pain,Sayin' such a shame,Then tryin' to go on with my life,Of that, I too, am guilty,(Seems like we don't even care),So we send a lil' money, tell 'em it's alright,To be able to sleep at night,You will pay that price,While some of these folks' lost their whole life,(Seems like we don't even care),Now it wasn't on the nightly news no more,Suddenly it didn't matter to you no more,In the end almost nothing changed,What the hell, what was that for?,(Seems like we don't even care),[Outro: News Excerpts],...Buses are on the way to take those people from New Orleans to Houston,...They lyin',...People are dying at the convention center,...Their government has failed them,...George Bush doesn't care about black people

",Jay-Z:The Prelude
The Black Album (2003),Jay-Z,"""And the other night when I was, researching, what we were going to be discussing today, I came across a passage that, I think it really exemplifies what the young brother next to me was talking about, and that all things must come to an end. It is an inevitable part of the cycle of existence. All things must conclude. Take the analogy of a tree that grows in Brooklyn, among the steel and concrete with all of its glorious branches and leaves. One day he too will pass on his legacy, through the seeds that drop to the ground. And as the wind carry these seeds throughout the land, a new life will begin for each one of them as they stand for a monument to the one that came before.""

,Jay-Z,"[Jay-Z] Uh-huh,[$hort] That's right,[Jay-Z] Uh-huh-uh, it was all good just a week ago,[$hort] Last week I had everything,[Jay-Z] Uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago,[$hort] I had the money... had the cars, the bitches,[Jay-Z] Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago,[$hort] and the jewelry... and then my muthafuckin' niggas started snitchin',[Jay-Z] Uh-huh, uh uh, yo,[$hort] Bitch!,Verse 1: Jay-Z,Growin up in the hood just my dog and me,We used to hustle in the hood for, all to see,Problems, I called on him, he called on me,We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P,Met him unlocked doors, off my keys,Yeah we spoke, much more than cordially,Man he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly,The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly,Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me,Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed,Used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change,And when he called collect and I heard his name,I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone,he's talkin reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone,I said, ""Damn dawg, what, nine weeks and you're home?"",He said, ""Main man, you think shit's sweet cause you're home."",I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone,The crackers up there bleachin' your dome, you're reachin',I said, ""The world don't stop I've got to keep keep on."",From there I sensed the beef was on,I ran to the spot, store to add some more features to my phone,To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone,Can't be too safe cause niggas is 2-faced,And they show the other side when they catch a new case,It's on,Chorus: Too $hort, Jay-Z,It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke,And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks,I don't see how this side of you could be provoked,Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago,Funny what, 7 days can change,A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim,Used to have a firm grip now you droppin names,Uh-huh, uh-huh It was all good just a week ago,Verse 2: Jay-Z,Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell,We both came in this game, blind as hell,I did a little better, had more clientele,Told you put away some cheddar now you cryin' for bail,Seventeen and I'm holdin' on to around a mill,I could bail out and blow trial and come around on Appeal,Had niggas thinkin' I was from Uptown for real,I had so much hustle plus I was down to ill,Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville,Down and dirty, down to fight the round 30,Freezin on them corners still holdin' my crack,Lookin up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?,Came from flat broke to lettin the dough stack,You tell them feds I said I'm never goin back,I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats,You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious,Chorus:,It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke,And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks,I don't see how this side of you could be provoked,Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago,Funny what, 7 days can change,A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim,Used to have a firm grip now you droppin names,Uh-huh, uh-huh It was all good just a week ago,Verse 3: Jay-Z,The lawyer I retained you said you leakin' some things,All this after a week in the bang,I'm mad at myself cause I didn't spot the weak and lame,I woulda bet the house you wouldn't speak a thang,Nigga this was the oath, to the top of broke,Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us,we sposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?,Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor,Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry,That's right, the same game that make you mad could make you die,It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap,Who woulda thought you'd get popped one time and rat?,Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad,and your son gotta grow up like, ""This is my dad?"",The labelling of a snitch is a lifetime scar,You'll always be in jail nigga, just minus the bars,Chorus:,It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke,And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks,I don't see how this side of you could be provoked,Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago,Funny what, 7 days can change,A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim,Used to have a firm grip now you droppin names,Uh-huh, uh-huh It was all good just a week ago,[Too $hort],Shit is crazy man,All these niggas out here snitchin',We was one step away from takin' this crack money,and recyclin' it through the ghetto's,and buildin' back up our own hoods,Now all you niggas start snitchin on each other,I got partners doin 15-20,Wouldn't of been doin' shit if you didn't snitch!,Bitch!,It's about time y'all check that shit out man,It ain't all good,Shut your mouth,Just watch the game,And don't snitch,It sure will do a lot for you,Believe that baby,Jay-Z, Short Dawg's in the house main,You know I got it,Got it goin on,We got the money,Ain't

Just thought I'd remind ya'll,Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy, son/ Ain't nothing nice,Verse 2,I'm from the place where the church is the flakiest,And niggas is praying to god so long that they atheist,Where you can't put your vest away and say you'll wear it tomorrow,Cause the day after we'll be saying, damn I was just with him yesterday,I'm a block away from hell, not enough shots away from straight shells,An ounce away from a triple beam still using a hand-held weight scale,You're laughing, you know the place well,Where the liquor stores and the base DWELL,And Government, fuck Government, niggas POLITIC themselves,Where we call the cops the A-Team,cause they hop out of vans and spray things,And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eighteen,Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies,So tell me when I rap you think I give a fuck who criticize?,If the shit is lies, god strike me,And I got a question, are you forgiving guys who live just like me?,We'll never know,One day I pray to you and said if I ever blow, I'D LET EM KNOW, ,MISTAKES and exactly what takes place in the ghetto,Promise fulfilled, but still I feel my job ain't done,Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice,Verse 3,I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards,Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen,I'm up the block, round the corner, and down the street,From where the pimps, prostitutes, and the drug lords meet,We make a million off of beats, 'cause our stories is deep,And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet,Niggas get lost for weeks in the streets, twisted off LEEK,And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat,Whether you'RE four feet or MANUTE-SIZE, it always starts out with,Three dice and shoot the five,Niggas thought they douce was live, UNTIL I hit 'em with trips,And I reached down for their money, pa forget about this,This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist,And this glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this,Niggas will show you love, That's how they fool thugs,Before you know it you'RE lying in a pool of blood

Hectic,Had to call upon my wolves to send, niggas the message,I said this: 'Let's play fair and we can stay here,I'm trying to transform you Boyz II Men like daycare',Hey there's money to be made and, niggas got the picture,Stopped playing with my paper and, we got richer,Then hard times fell upon us, half of my staff,had warrants, the other half, in the casket lay dormant,I felt like life was cheating me, for the first time,in my life I was getting money but it was like my conscience was eating me,Was this a lesson God teaching me? Was he saying that?,I'm playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back,like bad coke, pimp or die, was my mindframe bad,Was niggas was thinkin simplify was turnin cocaine crack/,Ain't a whole lot of brain to that, just trying to maintain a stack,and not collide like two trains that's on the same track,'Fore I get my life together like the oars I bring back,In the bottom of the pot where no, water gets hot,Got my transporter take it 'cross the border then stop,Set up shop with a quarter of rock, here's the plan,For three straight weeks, niggas slaughtered the block,But you know the game is 'lluted, that fucked up me and my dues,One drop can wipe a nigga out, faster than the cops,and this unstable way of living just, had to stop,Half of my niggas got time, we done real things,By ninety-four became the subject of half of y'all niggas rhymes,Public apoligies to the families of those caught up in my shit,But that's the life for us lost souls brought up in the shit,The life and times of a nigga mind, excited with crime,And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind,I figured, 'Shit why risk myself I just write it in rhymes,And let you feel me, and if you don't like it then fine',The mindstate, of a nigga who boosted the crime rate,so high in one city they send National Guards to get me
