I was wrong...,Again,,I was wrong.,Life is lonely again,,And only last year everything seemed so sure.,Now life is awful again,,A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.,A week in paris will ease the bite of it,,All I care is to smile in spite of it.,I'll forget you, I will,While yet you are still burning inside my brain.,Romance is mush,,Stifling those who strive.,I'll live a lush life in some small dive...,And there I'll be, while I rot,With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..

",Queen Latifah:Mama Gave Birth To The Soul Children
,Queen Latifah,"Alright listen, I'm back again cause that's what you required of,Me steady rhyming, and I'm so sick and tired of,Being forced to put suckers in their place,You make me mad enough to punch you in the face,But I'm not trying, so never sound like I don't bone to pick with you,Show and prove that you can stand on your own two,I speak the poetry, dissing those who keep on quoting me,Try to play me, cease it, you don't know me,So smile in my face, behind my back take a line or two,I'm not an idiot, so who you think you lying to?,Queen Latifah's here to lay the law down,So speed it up or shake it around because it's a showdown,The 45 King is arising, suprising, hypnotising star, he's up to par,So I hope you've prepared yourself for what you're in for,This is Latifah's Law,BMW's and gold rope chains don't impress me,Or get you closer to the point you can undress me,Get skeezed, you nose will bleed, that's how they live life,Prepare to feel the wrath of the giver of all life,Fire and desire make you go a little higher,When I grab the wire of the mic,And get hype, I'm sorry you sound dot,Cause I roll like the homicide squad,You must be broke and, hoping that I'm soft but I'm dope and,Left you in the litter to consider coping with,Life, it's trife yeah, but these things happen,You need to make it better, stop trying to be the mack again,Get a grip on the African way,Cause there's a sucker born every day,Crime's the way for you to see what the Queen saw,And this is Latifah's law,Now DJ Mark made up a beat that he can bring you,And I of course supply the rhyme that you can swing to,The Flavor Unit keeps all, and keeps a way to band,And slides keep the hardcore fall, cause I'm heavy-handed,Whip out a .45 caliber pen and begin,A funky message from beginning to end,Peace be to Africa, can't forget my other land,Won't fulfill my heart unless I speak about the motherland,You say you're living right, but we know it's nonsense,In case you forgot, just check your conscience,At showtime, I blow lines, you don't get yours, I get mine,Your showtimes, you behind, the Queen Latifah divine,Rule number one: don't step across the line that I drew,Number two: don't take credit for something that you didn't do,Number three: check your heart, every man has a call,It's time for me to go, but I'll be back, y'all
