",Eazy-E:Boyz N The Hood (Remix)
,Eazy-E,"Woke up quick at about noon,Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon,I gotta get drunk before the day began,Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends,About to go and damn near went blind,Young niggaz throwin' up pads, throwin' up gang signs,I ran in the house to get the clip,With my Mac-10 on the side of my hip,I bailed outside and I pointed my weapon,Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin',I jumped in the floor, hit the juice on my ride,I got front and back, side to side,Then I let the Alpine play,I was bumpin' new shit by NWA,It was 'Gangsta Gangsta' at the top of the list,Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this,Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo',Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes,I went to the park to get the scoop,Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops,A car pulls up, who can it be?,A fresh El Camino rollin', Kilo G,He rolls down the window and he starts to say,It's all about makin' that GTA,'Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard,Come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card,Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit,Don't quote me boy, I ain't said shit,Bored as hell and I wanna get ill,So I go to a place where my homeboys chill,The fellows out there tryna make that dollar,I pulled up in my 64 Impala,Greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin',And from the 8-ball my breath start stinkin',I gotta get my girl to rock that body,Before I left I hit the Bacardi,Went to the house to get her out of the pad,Dumb hoe said something to make me mad,She said somethin' that I couldn't believe,So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave,Started talkin' shit, wouldn't she know?,I reached back like a pimp and I slapped the hoe,Father stood up and he started to shout,So I threw a right-cross and I dissolved out,'Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard,Come talkin' that trash and we'll pull your card,Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit,Don't quote me boy, I ain't said shit,[Incomprehensible] trippin , it's alright,Homie's scored a key, he's gonna fly,Punk fly

I want you all face-down on the floor,Anybody moves and I shoot),Stackin up the money and there's more to collect,cause I don't give a fuck, I take traveler's checks,Yo, Ren, peep out the window, and tell me what you see,(Three motherfuckin police starin at me; what to do now?),Hurry up and get on,Allright, tell me, who is the motherfuckin alarm?,I'm a give ya a chance, and count to three,or else five of ya bitches are comin with me,(Police: Allright, Allright, come out niggaz, or we're coming in,This is the only chance to turn yourself in),Fuck you! We got hostages, and plenty of loot,and don't give a damn and not afraid to shoot,We're sendin out the hostages, all except five,and if you don't meet our demands, they won't stay alive,We want a copter, so we can get away clean,and take some pussy along, if you know what I mean,One hostage got brave, and got off the floor,but I smoked his ass before he got to the door,(Police: They shot a hostage, they shot a hostage!),(MC Ren: You stupid motherfucker tryin' to run,now you're dead as fuck tryin' to race a gun),(Police: Allright, this is the last chance to get off your ass,or else the tear gas is about to blast),I ran to the back and Ren followed behind,to a hell of a spot that was hard to find,The bank was fucked up, the shit was smokin,with screamin hostages, runnin and chokin,Gettin away, but I was suddenly stopped,at point blank range, by a motherfuckin cop,And I hope they don't think that a lesson was taught,cause a nigga like the E was finally caught,My gat wouldn't fire, the shit wouldn't work,So, y'all know what time it is,Chorus,(Police: Well I'm giving you five seconds to let us thru the gate or,I'm gonna shoot two of your guards),(Hehe, they got me once, but they'll never get me again)
