Run-DMC (1984),Run-D.M.C.,"Hard times spreading just like the flu,Watch out homeboy, don't let it catch you,P-p-prices go up, don't let your pocket go down,When you got short money you're stuck on the ground,Turn around, get ready, keep your eye on the prize,And be on point for the future shock,Hard times,Hard times,Hard times are coming to your town,So stay alert, don't let them get you down,They tell you times are tough, you hear that times are hard,But when you work for that ace you know you pulled the right card,Hard times got our pockets all in chains,I'll tell you what, homeboy, it don't have my brain,All day I have to work at my peak,Because I need that dollar every day of the week,Hard times,Hard times can take you on a natural trip,So keep your balance, and don't you slip,Hard times is nothing new on me,I'm gonna use my strong mentality,Like the cream of the crop, like the crop of the cream,B-b-beating hard times, that is my theme,Hard times in life, hard times in death,I'm gonna keep on fighting to my very last breath,Hard times,Hard times,Hard times,Hard times,Hard times,Hard times,Hard times...
