Got a long white beard,,maybe looks kind of weird, and if you ever seen him he could give a,quite shock. Now people let me tell ya about last year when the,dude came flying over here, Well the hawk was out the snow's on the,ground, folks stayed into party down. The beat was thumping on the,blcok, and I was dancing in my sockS, and the drummer played at a,solid pace, and a taste of the base was in my face. And the guitar,laid down a heavy layer of the funky junky rhythm of the,disco Beat. And the guy with the 88 started to participate, and I,could Sure appreciate it sound so sweat.,We were all in the mood so we had a little food, and a joke, and a,smoke, and a little bit of wine, when I thought I heard a hoof on,Top of the roof. Could it be or was it me, I was feeling super,fine. So I went to the attic where I thought heard the static,on a chance that the prance was somebody breaking in. But the,noise on the top was a reindeer clop, Just a trick St. Nick, and I,let the sucker in.,He was roly, he was Poly and not the holy moly, you got a lot of,whiskers on your chinny, chin, chin. He allowed, he was proud of,the hairy little crowd on the point of the door where the skin,should've been.,Get's cool for a fool throwin' out every you for a day on sleigh,where the cold winds blow. So the beard maybe cleared,But I never have a cheered cause it's warm in the storm when it's,ten below,I said you're right it's cold tonight,,Can you stop for a drop before you go?,He said why not if the music'S hot and I'll chance a dance beneath,the mistletoe.,So he went downstairs and forgot his cares and he rocked the spot,and danced like a,pro,And every young girl tried to rock his world,But he boogie oogie oogied till he had to go,And before he went this fine old gent,Finding gifts went to sift through his big red bags,In the top for the bottom he reached in and got toys ?-------? on a,girls flat rag,And the grownups got some presents too,A new TV and a stere-u. A new Seville 'bout as blue as the sky,The best that money couldn't buy,Cause money could never ever buy the feelin,the one that comes from not concealin,

Ho-oo!,Hi-yo! Hi-yo!,Say Kurtis! Kurtis!,Say Kurtis Blow!
