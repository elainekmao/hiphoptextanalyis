Check Your Head (1992),Beastie Boys,"I don't see things quite the same as I used to,As I live my life I've got just me to be true to,And when I find that I don't know about just what to do,I turn and look within to see what I should do,Now I'm not sure what it takes to be hip,A lot of people making music that to me ain't shit,So I ask creation for rhymes for this jam,Give my lick a solo when I take the mic stand,Yeah, as the earth spins into a brand new day,I see the light on my horizon's not fading away,Gonna shine from within like a bright white sun,No need to hide and no place to run,Got the vibrations of the music bringing light to your mind,So you can move and groove and feel the beat of time,Sense the power in the air as it starts to move,You get a real good feeling that you just can't lose,Free your mind it's time for good times,And let yourself move it's a time to shine,Spread your wings in the sky, feeling good inside,You're breaking through with no need to hide,I got the music coming come on take control of my soul,I can't hold back I've got to let go,Stand together people come together now,It's about time we got to get together now,Stand together people come together now,I said it's about time we got to get together now c'mon,Stand together people come together now,I said it's about time we got to get together y'all

Check Your Head (1992),Beastie Boys,"A butterfly floats on the breeze of a sun lit day,As I feel this reality gently fade away,Riding on a thought to see where it's from,Gliding through a memory of a time yet to come,Smoke paints the air,Swirling images through my mind,Like a whirlpool spin beginning to unwind,And I stand at the edge cautiously awaiting,As time slips by,Carefully navigating by the stars in the sky,And I sit,And I think to myself,And on the horizon the sun light begins to climb,And it seems like it's been so long since he shined,But I'm sure it was only yesterday,A cold chill of fear cut through me,I felt my heart contract,To my mind I brought the image of light,And I expanded out of it,My fear was just a shadow,And then I voice spoke in my head,And she said dark is not the opposite of light,It's the absence of light,And I thought to myself,She knows what she's talking about,And for a moment I knew what it was all about

Boy sing,I AM one with myself as I turn to The,I prefer the dreams to reality,I prefer my life don't need no other man's wife,Don't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife,But it's good to have turn to be a king for a day,Or for a week or for a year or for a year in a day,Come what may,I'm fishing in my boat and I'm fishing for trout,Mix the Bass Ale with the Guiness Stout,Fishing for a line inside my brain,And looking out at the world through my window pane,Every day has many colors cuz the glass is stained,Everything has changed but remains the same,So once again the mirror raised,And I see myself as clear as day,And I AM going to the limits of my ultimate destiny,Feeling as though Somebody were testing me,He who sees the end from the beginning of time,Looking forward through all the ages is, was and always shall be,Check the prophetic sections of the pages,He goes by the name of Disco Dave,[Hello Brooklyn],Hello Brooklyn,New York New York it's a hell of a town,The Bronx is up and I'm Brooklyn down,Because they don't know my name they only know my initials,Building bombs in the attic for elected officials,I quit my job, I cut my hair,I cut my boss because I don't care,You tried to get slick you bust a little chuckle,You're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle,'Cause being as fly as me is something you never thought of,You'll be sticking up old ladies with the hand gun or the sawed-off,Like a buffalo soldier I'm broader than Broadway,Keep keepin' on I don't care what they say,I play my stereo loud it disturbs my neighbors,I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor,'Cause I am the holder of the 3-pack Bonanza,If you open the book then you will get your hand slapped,I am the keeper of the 3-pack Bonanza,If you ask a question then you will get the answer,Her breast I saw I reached I felt,M-O-N-E-Y the belt,I stay at home just like a hermit,I got the jammy but I don't got the permit,Yes you got a boyfriend and indeed his name is Nick,That is why Annabelle you're caught with the shrimpy limp dick,I ride around town 'cause my ride is fly,I shot a man in Brooklyn,[Dropping Names],He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost,He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost,She's slippin' through his fingers as she's movin' out to the coast,He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost,If your world was all black and if your world was all white,Then you wouldn't get much color out of life now right,A nicknamed Shamrock my name is not Shamus,Girlies on the tippy cause my homie is famous,My name is not O'Houigheighi Nor is it Brian,If I said that I was weak you know I'd be lyin',Suckers try to bite they try to pursue it,(If you explain to a musician, he know it but he can't do it),[Lay It On Me],I got Chinese eyes and Chinese suits,Smokin' much Buddha and smokin' much boots,More updated on the hip-hop lingo,My favorite New York Knick was Hawthorne Wingo,Met a girl at a party and I gave her my card,Man, you know that it said Napoleon Bonaparte,Peepin' out the colors I be buggin' on Cezanne,They call me Mike D Joe Blow the Lover Man,Your face turns red as your glass of wine,You spilled on my lyrics as you wasted my time,Girl you should be with me you should drop that bum,'Cause I got more flavor than Fruit Striped Gum,With that big round butt of yours,I'd

last night with a peculiar cackle,I laid the bait and then she took the tackle,Had too much to drink at the Red Lobster,Now the room is spinning around like the blades of a helicopter,I never met a girl that was too finicky,If the press has their way then they're going to finish me,You might know this but you've never been this see,If I ate spinach then I'd be called Spinach D,I shed light like cats shed fur,Ride around town like Raymond Burr,I'm so high that they call me Your Highness,So, if you don't know me then pardon my shyness,I live in the Village wherever I go I walk to,I keep my friends around so I have someone to talk to,I play my music loud because you know it's got clout to it,[AWOL],Take the ""A"" train!,When Mike D's in the house what you gonna' do,I go A.W.O.L.,Adrock's

Licensed To Ill (1986),Beastie Boys,"Well this girl came up to me, she says she's new in town,But the crew been said they seen her around,I thought they were right but I didn't wanna know,The girlie was Def and she wanted to go,I think her name is Lucy but they all call Loose,I think I thought I seen her on eighth and forty-deuce,The next thing she said was, ,We got into the cab, the cab driver said,He recognized my girlie from the back of her head,He said a little something about tip to base,So I made him stop the cab to get out of the place,I shouldn't have looked back man I'll always regret it,Something's going on and I'll probably never get it,She was crying like a baby, stupid dumb,It's just too bad that girl's a bum,She's crafty - she's gets around,She's crafty - she's always down,She's crafty - she's got a gripe,She's crafty - and she's just my type,She's crafty,I spent my last dollar to buy a Sabrett,When I seen this girl I could never forget,Now I like nothing better than a pretty girl smile,And I haven't seen a smile that pretty in a while,The girl came up to me she said she loved the show,Asked her to come home and she couldn't say no,We got the crib - there's Adam and D.,We didn't say a word - they just stared at me,I said, ,And Ad-Rock started hiding everything in sight,D. pulled me over said, ,The girl is crafty, she knows all the moves,I started playing records, she knew all the grooves,He thought she was a thief and D. was right,But I'm just thinkin' she'd spend the night,When I woke up late in the afternoon,She had taken all the things from inside his room,I found myself naked in the middle of the floor,She had taken the bed and the chest of drawers,The mirror, the TV, the new guitar cord,My remote control and my old skateboard,She robbed us blind, she took all we owned,And the boys blamed me for bringing her home,She's crafty - she's gets around,She's crafty - she's always down,She's crafty - she's got a gripe,She's crafty - and she's just my type,She's crafty,Oh yeah,She's crafty - she's gets around,She's crafty - she's always down,She's crafty - she's got a gripe,She's crafty - and she's just my type,She's crafty - she's gets around,She's crafty - she's always down,She's crafty - she's got a gripe,She's crafty - and she's just my type,She's crafty

The Smurf,Taxing all females from coast to coast,And when I get my fill I'm chilly most,We rag-tag girlies back at the hotel,And then we all switch places when I ring the bell,I chill at White Castle 'cause it's the best,But I'm fly at Fat Burger when I way out west,K-I-N-G-A-D whammy,All the fly ladies are on my jammy,Went to the prom - wore the fly blue rental,Got six girlies in my Lincoln Continental,I had this girl at the party and she started to flirt,I told her some rhymes and she pulled up her skirt,Spent some bank - I got a high powered jumbo,Rolled up a wooly and I watched Colombo,Let me clear my throat - Kick it over here baby pop,And let all the fly skimmies, feel the beat...drop,Coolin' on the corner on a hot summer's day,Just me, my posse and M.C.A.,A lot of beer - a lot of girls - and a lot of cursing,Twenty-two automatic on my person,Got my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger,My posse's gettin' big and my posse's gettin' bigger,Some voices got treble, some voices got bass,We got the kind of voices that are in your face,Like the bun to the burger and like the burger to the bun,Like the cherry to the apple, to the peach to the plum,I'm the king of the Ave. - and I'm the king of the block,I'm M.C.A. - and I'm the King Adrock,Well I'm Mike D. - I got all the fly juice,On the checkin' at the party on the forty deuce,Walking down the block with the fresh fly threads, fly the biggest heads,Ho...,Ho...,Ho...,Ho...

Licensed To Ill (1986),Beastie Boys,"They got a committee to get me off the block,'Cause I say my rhymes loud and I say 'em nonstop,Because being bad news is what we're all about,We went to White Castle and we got thrown out,I got my boy Mike D. - I got the King Ad-Rock ,I got the jammy with the ammo inside my sock,I shot homeboy but the bullet was a dud,So I reached in the Miller cooler, grabbed a cool Bud,Slow riding, gun hidin' on the go,I'm fly like an eagle and I drink Old Crow,I'm the king of the classroom, coolin' in the back,My teacher had beef so I gave her a smack,She chased me out of class, she was strapped with a ruler,Went to the bathroom, rolled myself a wooler,With bottle in hand at the microphone stand,Ay yo homeboy - what you drinkin' man,I got money - I got juice,I got to the party and I got loose,I got rhythms - I got rhymes,I got the girlies with the Def behinds,I got ill - I got busted,I got dust and I got dusted,I got gold - I got funky,I got the new dance - they call the ,Because I'm hard hittin' - always bitten - cool as hell,I got trees on my mirror so my car won't smell,Sittin' around the house - gettin' high and watchin' tube,I'm eating Colonel's chicken - drinkin' Heineken brew,I'm a gangster, I'm a prankster - I'm the king of the Ave.,I'm hated, confrontated for the juice that I have,All the fly ladies are making a fuss,But I can't pay attention, 'cause I'm on that dust
