"Stillmatic (2001),Like Mike (2002)",Nas,"Yeah,Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,Nas, uh,Yo, yo, life, they wonder. ,Can they take me under? Nah, never that!,Yo, yo, I come from the housing tenement buildings,Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death,Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell,Though I owe to it my success,Well, survival of the fittest every day as a child,I would think I'm a part of USA and be proud,Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign,Like the darker you are the realer your problems,I reached for the stars, but I just kept slipping,On this life mission, never know what's next,Ain't your king from Fiji, welcome Julius Caesar,Had a piece of the globe, every continent,There was Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan,Pakistan, America, Afghanistan,Yo there was Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics,Call a truce, world peace, stop acting like savages,No war, we should take time and think,The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct,Cut since the beginning of time, it's been man with arms fighting,Lost lives in the towers and Pentagons,Why then must it on, we must stop the killing,Tell me why we die, we all God's children,All this hate can't last forever,It's time that we stand together,Everybody wants to rule the world,Come on (World, world, world),Peace (World, world, world),Peace (World, world, world),Peace (World, world, world),All those brothers on the block posted up like they own it,That's Daytona from New York to California,Got blocks locked down,Like, dog, you safe whenever you with me,See, this is my town,So the youngstas, pros and ghettos goes to prison,At a early age, already know it's against them,So in order for him to survive one day,He must open up his eyes to the set backs,'Cause everybody wants a shot in this land of opportunity,Look at what this country's got,There shouldn't be nobody homeless,How can the President fix all the problems when he ain't fixed home yet,The earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone,To all colors and creeds is to whom it belongs,I want land, mansions, banks and gold,The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control,The world's natural resources own its residuals,But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles,And I become the most wanted,But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by secret service,I guess attempts at my life are loaded barrels,So move over Colin Powell, just throw in a towel, yo,All this hate can't last forever,It's time that we stand together,Everybody wants to rule the world,Come on (World, world, world),Peace (World, world, world),Peace (World, world, world),Peace (World, world, world),Y'all know that's my style and hit you at the right time,No other compares to what Nas write down,Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours,You could get what you love, be a chain to cause,You alive right now,There's so many that dead or locked up inside the beast,I'ma holler it now,It's whatever man think'll manifest to be real,The plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals,All this hate can't forever last,All my ghetto heroes in heaven, it's like you right here and never passed,You just transcend, I know I'm gonna see you again,Hoping I'll reach the world leaders and win,Ain't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical,We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical,In hip hop the weapons are lyrical,To be the best, you challenge the best, and the blessing is spiritual,Top of the world for the kid none less,Popping any Rappers head off his shoulders, no contest,I know the most high hear me, so far you can't hear me,You scared of a mirror,My theory is that knowledge is power,To every projects and every street corner,We gotta get out of this now,All this hating lasts forever,It's time that we stand together,Everybody wants to rule the world

Tyrone, 'member no cursin front of Ms. Vercey,Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters,My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean,I knew, all that I'd seen had meant somethin,Learned early, to fear none little Nas was huntin,Livin carefree laughin, got jokes on the daily,Y'all actin like some old folks y'all don't hear me,Yo I'm in my second childhood,[Chorus: repeat 2X],""Cause when I flow the for the street.."" - "".. who else could it be"",""N-A-S"" - ""Nas.."",""Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.."" - ""Queensbridge"",""Make everything right.."" - ""Get yours, nigga"",[Nas],Yo, dude is 31, livin in his moms crib,Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid,Cornrows in his hair, still slingin, got a crew,They break his moms furniture, watchin Comicview,Got babies by different ladies high smokin L's,in the same spot he stood since, eighty-five well,When his stash slow, he be crazy,Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday,Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared,They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds,So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years,Sittin on, different benches like it's musical chairs,All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night,with young dudes it's them he wanna be like,It's sad but it's fun to him right? He never grew up,31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood,[Chorus],[Nas],Baby girl she's always talkin name droppin hangin late,Drinkin smokin hates her baby daddy, craves shoppin,E poppin Ecstasy takin, won't finish her education,Best friend she keeps changin, stuck with limitations,Lustin men, many hotels, Fendi Chanel,With nothin in her bank account frontin she do well,Her kid suffers he don't get that love he deserve,He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse,No job never stay workin, mad purty,Shorty they call her the brain surgeon,Time flyin she the same person, never matures,All her friends married doin well,She's in the streets yakkety yakkin like she was 12,Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights,Selfish in her own right for life,  guess she's in her second childhood,[Chorus],""Who else could it be.."" - ""N-A-S"" - ""Nas..""

",Nas:2nd Childhood
Nastradamus (1999),Nas,"[Jessica Care Moore],Global warming between my legs, screams against the waves,Gave birth to thirteen daughters, so now we never run out of water,My skin layered in diamonds and sage,Left alone and confused, forces enslaved by days,Time keeps on whorin us,Ghetto saviors can't keep ignorin us,Flowers and flames, flutes from her fingers,Rifles pointed from her sac,or was it simply a bag of sticks and stones,Either way, she wore a compass on her head,Rains don't stop the grass from turnin red,Her hair was half perm, half dread,We gave up walking in a past-life and so we dance,Arms wrapped around my breath and choked me back to life,A new world wife, reflecting the sun and rolling dice,Symbol of the drama yet to come - too late to run,Time travelling was late,Watching was a blind man's mistake,All his assets melted right in front of his face,His right leg drabbed with demon paste,Shoes stayed angel laced,Never count your blessings with haste,Even a prophet can catch a case,Didn't realize how sweet the future might taste,Telepathically cutting through mental gates,Words were weapons against their hate,Shepherds search for stars in her hair,Her chest grew fermented like yeast,She broke her body like aged bread,He gave her truth from all the books he'd read,She wrote her poems inside the mud,Sacrificed her cervix to fix the future,Named their boys and spit truth inside his mouth,Read warm prophet, writing twisted scriptures inside her belly,Resurrected from bones and dirt,She made hard niggaz smile,Left her seeds inside the Earth,Gave hustlers and killers life's worth,This is the life we chose, remember who was here first,Find a reason why you curse,Gold rushed tongues by dreams too loose,Sporting electronic nooses,Hoeing humanity love-ticks over lust,Despite the damage to destiny you can't take the best of me,In God We Still Trust

,Nas,"Uh uh, yo,They plan was to knock me out the top of the game,But I overstand they truth is all lame,I hold cannons that shoot balls of flames,Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name,Nas - too real, Nas - true king,It's however you feel, g'head, you swing,Your arms too short to box with god,I don't kill soloists only kill squads,Fame went to they head, so now it's ""F**k Nas"",Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys,I seen it comin,Soon as I popped my first bottle I spotted my enemies tryna' do what I do,Came in with my style, so I fathered you,I kept changin on the world since ""...Barbeque"",Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with,F**k bitches I hit, it's funny I once said...,If I, ever make a record,I take a check and put something away for a rainy day to make my exit,But look at me now, ten years deep,Since the project, ??,I never asked to be top of rap's elite,Just a ghetto child tryna' learn the traps of the streets,But look at me now,[Chorus],""You're the man"" ""You're the man"",""You're the man"" ""You're the man"",""You're the man"" ""You're the man"",""You're the man"" ""You're the man"",""You're the man"" ""You're the man"",But wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars,And diamond rings can poison a rap star,It's suicidal, how I smoke in so much la',I saw a dead bird flyin through a broken sky,Wish I could flap wings and fly away,To where black kings and Ghana stay ,So I could get on my flesh right away,But that'll be the day when it's peace,When my gat don't need to spray,When these streets are safe to play,Sex with death, indulge in these women,Vision my own skeleton swimmin in eternal fire,Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina,Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds,I beg for God's help, why they love hurtin me?,I'm your disciple, a thug certainly,I'm the N the A to the S-I-R,If I wasn't I must've been Escobar,Forty-five in my waist, starin at my reflection,In the mirror, sittin still in the chair like my conception,When everything around me got cloudy, the chair became a king's throne,My destiny found me,It was clear why the struggle was so painful,Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to,And God, I'm so thankful,[Chorus to fade]

Phoenix],Every corner, every city,There's a place where life's a little easy,Little Hennessy, laid back and cool,Every hour, cause it's all good,Leave all the stress from the world outside,Every wrong done will be alright,Nothin but peace, love,And street passion, every ghetto needs a Thugz Mansion,[Verse two: Tupac],Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good,Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods,Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook,Drippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke,Then some lady named Billie Holiday,Sang sittin there kickin it with Malcolm, 'til the day came,Little LaTasha sho' grown,Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home,Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us,When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band,Just think of all the people that you knew in the past,that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last,Picture a place that they exist, together,There has to be a place better than this, in heaven,So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin,Remember this face, save me a place, in Thugz Mansion,[Chorus: J. Phoenix],Every corner, every city,There's a place where life's a little easy,Little Hennessy, laid back and cool,Every hour, cause it's all good,Leave all the stress from the world outside,Every wrong done will be alright,Nothin but peace, love,And street passion, every ghetto needs a Thugz Mansion,[Verse three: Nas],A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide,Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin by,No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets,No reason, for nobody's momma to cry,See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin to stick around for my daughter,But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her,This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me,Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe,Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin,I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother,And I cried tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy,I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur,Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war,And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more,Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin heavnly champagne,What angels saw, with golden wings in Thugz Mansion,[Chorus: J. Phoenix],Every corner, every city,There's a place where life's a little easy,Little Hennessy, laid back and cool,Every hour, cause it's all good,Leave all the stress from the world outside,Every wrong done will be alright,Nothin but peace, love,And street passion, every ghetto needs a Thugz Mansion

There ain't no stopping or cruising,Even when we're battered and bruised,Out run all the sprinters,On Mount Olympus,My God tougher than Zues!,Repeat Chorus,Verse - Nas,As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,New York to Calli,For the money power respect,It's a journey,Some will get left behind,'cause in life,You can not press rewind,Get it right,You only have one first chance,To make on first impression that lasts a lifetime,Reputation supersede itself,Do you believe in hell?,Babylon greed for wealth,Do you deceive yourself and let your ego swell?,And disregard those who most need your help!,Think skin,The dark won't take my soul,Survive spiritual wars,See my welts,And the evil's felt but the faith is stronger,I saw grown men fall when I was a youngster,But I clenched my fists,Ready to go against whoever,Tied my Tims and rise in the end,Repeat Chorus,Verse - Jr. Gong,No man live forever,But never say never,Every 'goody' want better,Just be a go getter,And always be clever,In every endeavor,Cause drastic times call for drastic measure,Your birthright to pleasure,From your naval string sever,The land and the treasure,Work for whatever,Jah say don't be a beggar,The Alfa Omega,Who bless ever soul,No matter which name you prefer,The Immortal Stepper,Who lives in ever skin no matter which color leather,Would never let we down no care which kind of weather,You're destined to rise like the son of Rebecca,Don't stop for a second,Every man recon,It sure would be good to be there,Whether Zion or Mecca,When gates are finally closed,And the Saints go marching in.

Might as well make it same as your dome,You need your thoughts together, that means destination is unknown,As we travel on this road, an infinite path, I get into this math,Drop and get intense for this cash,Will I be subject to kill, live my life by a gat,Just when I think I made it out, the street is calling me back,Chorus:,(Nature),I know a lot of fiends by they first name,Living in Queens, a lot of cats getting stuck for they chains,Holding dirty guns, the young owe dirty ones,Running wild, niggaz I raise hell above ground,Live in sin, holding rocks, benjamin grin,Figure once I got knocked, it would end,Never that,They try to tell me I don't love my own,The thugs know, they ride my zone,Like the cyclone trademark,For coney isle, yeah you know me now,I'm giving fake hugs, phoney smiles,Stack profits, you know how the niggaz on the block get,Try to give you dap to stare at your pockets,Cruise advance nothing new just the rules of the land,You could tell if they wolves or lamb,You could fight a few, there's a few that ran,Or you could feed them and lose your hand,What you wanna do?,Chorus:,(Nas),Blessing be to the ones who left us,Transcend into spiritual essences,In Allah's arms you rest in,To him we pray for my peeps,Floyd, Twin and Taiyeh, Mr. Sunny back in the day,Get the money yam, he use to say not only nice with hands,But streetsmart he was twice a man,I try to understand life's deep plot,I think of Weewop, Shikeisha they both was mad nice on the rocks,They could have went pro but only God knows why not,Like my nigga Bing, let your sneakers not be clean,He'll start snapping on you, making a scene,Kept the lye, a cool nigga warm heart and stayed fly,You still alive, I see you in your sister's face,Are you there pa? Or looking on from a distant place?,My thoroughbreds, Blackhead quiet but real,Expect to see your black jeep fly over the hill,In the spirit of Richie Lou tribute,Remind the world of the crimes that NY pigs do,We miss you, Harry and Sonia,Rest in peace to Marty, a 41st side of Vernon soldier,T.J.

,Nas,"To My Nigger who brought me in this world,Taught us right Nigger,My old dad imported to the family structure,Provide her God,My moms a queen at university civaliza,My pops maybe was late but always came home,My moms would put us to bed and she would wait on,Soon as he walk in the door she barking,I turned out the Jonny Carson,Jumped out the bed,We grabbed both his legs,Me and my brother,Not knowing the pain he gave my mother,Night after night, fighting yelling at each other,My papa played the street all day,Mama was either home, at work, while we played inside the hall way,She sacrifices all she got to feed us,When she was alone she cried by the phone pepping out the window heeding,But still I didn't see it,Mama hid it from us,We was kids younger,Till we got bigger, on to,Bigger things that we knew what the time was,That daddy was leaving the crib and moms love,Papa was player, player wasn't papa ,Papa loved the ladies,Never got enough of,Pretty brown round,Running round town (Shhhhh),Don't tell your mother what's going down,(Repeat 2x),So many kids I knew, never knew what Pap was,That's why I show my pop love,He was still around when I f**ked up,He could have left,My moms pregnant shock to death but stayed,Watch me crawl till I took my first step, to the first grade,To my first fist fight,Right behind me he would stand,No matter how big or tall he made me fight you like a man,Throw dirt in your eye, swing my right scoop your ass and slam ,He watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam,Roaches and weed all over my crib him and moms relaxing,Next thing you know he packing,So then I asked him,What's this white shit on that plate and your facing?,Papa why you butt ass from the waist,And who's this lady I'm facing,Dark skin you're not my mommy,He grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me,Promise things that he would buy me,If I kept my mouth close and don't tell mommy,He said one day I'll understand little me,Was in you to side me,Papa was player, player wasn't papa ,Papa loved the ladies,Never got enough of,Pretty brown round,Running round town (Shhhhh),Don't tell your mother what's going down,(Repeat 2x),Pop's told me hold my own,Pop's told me value home,Could I help it papa was a rolling stone,Who loved the pretty brown round,Out of town bound ,Jumping in his jazz Benz he touring,At home I play his latest recordings,And it's strange now how, I do my thing now,I'm in the game now,And heard of it his brain pow,To pull strings and gain power,>From weed habits are same now,No white lines to trumpets to tight rhymes,And beats that be pumping,Before he left he taught me something,A child's young years the most important time to be there,That's why he stayed till we grew up, respect is still here,I'm older now see what having a father's about,One day they can be in your life next day they be out,It's not because of you, you know the deal,Him and your moms feel,If they stay together then someone will get killed,I love you still,Always will,Cause that's my nigger,Although you felt you was wrong,I still feel you kid,Life gose on

Can't decide, that's a hard one,I mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled,Headline readin ""Rapper Slain From a Man Shootin""

I did that,Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids had,You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats,You precious more precious than lost treasure,Matter of fact I'm kinda hopin we can stay together,[Chorus:],Can't nobody love me like you do [x4],(Ooonononon I said they cant),[Nas:],I see you dressed up in white face covered in vail,Do I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwin rice,And it's the day that your father give you away,To a real man that gently put the ring on your hand,Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to,Now, look me in my eyes and say I do,Drivin off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates,We can spend our honeymoon in the states,You can throw your friend the bouquet,Somethin in the back of my head say,For us two, maybe cuz I love you,Hug you squeeze you touch you tease you,As long as we together it's heaven for me to please you,Won't stop til I tell you me to beautiful,Deeper and harder love layin new with you,Runnin my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by,While I'm wit you and I won't even care, word,[Chorus:],Can't nobody love me like you do [x4],(Ooonononon I said they cant),[Nas:],She been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, pa-pi's,Colombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas,Thug ones to those soft as baby shit,She been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips,Til one day she decided to flip,It was nuttin I can do about it, like she the boss and shit,Started talkin this divorcin shit,I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake,Half my car, half my kids? Can't get that,Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that,Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that,All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass,Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look,With her fine-ass body and a damn good cook,For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too,You my queen God bless you,[Chorus:],Can't nobody love me like you do [x4],(Ooonononon I said they cant),[Until fade]

Kelly],Street dreamer,Oh mercy mercy me,Ain't nothing I got for ya,Situations gettin heavy,Heavy, heavy,Trying to be a gangster,[Nas],The black clouds over the hood, I'm on the corner with the thugs ,Late night under the moon as they assume I'm slanging drugs,Cause I'm hooded up, thought a G a night wasn't good enough,Pushed my luck, yo they had a brother put in cuffs,Luckily, made it out of court comfortably,Judge said I need a job ain't nothing coming free,Could've got a one to three,I try to school these shorties under me,but they can't see ,From life to death,so know we back to where we never left the ghetto,It's a damn shame, knowing it's a man's game,Shorty thinks it's time to make ya plans change,All that running round trying to chase ,what's already here - been there, it's going nowhere,Pops told me knuckle up - no fear,I wish some of these killings,they could be prevented,whatever happens it was written,meaning God meant it,but during ya life you put ya heart in it,even though it seems we being targeted,let that brother R hit it,[Chorus] (extended),[Nas],Sort of wild, since a child, hope was all we had,Drip the bust out past,complaning the mental straining,how many in my crew is into gaining,subtract the weak links about the chaining,rise it start raining,Blasphemy using Nas name in vain,Some claim supreme being yet they lied in his name,I tried to learn the game,and the only thing I found incredible,Everything I tried to learn see, I already knew (that's right),And it's embedded in my heart now ,so I can sit back, count a stack,and play my part now,I saw my life flash in front of my eyes, he wore disguise,Put a gun to me hungry he went on to chastize,That's Nas ain't it, made it rich from entertainment,Fresh Wally's painted, as he told the kid he came with,My first thought was how the game flip,Yo perhaps it was somebody I smacked drunk in a party on yak,Or was I marked for a contract for some foul act,I did a while back or beyond that,You got me laying face flat,Saying my grace black, woke up in a cold sweat,Yo, I hate that,Nightmares, feeling real, word to Will,My A-Alike I lost in the battlefield,That's why I hit the mic with mad appeal,Grab ya shield and meet ya maker,Queens niggaz die for paper,These the things the street dreams will take ya,[Chorus] (repeat to the end)
