,MC Hammer,"[Chorus 2x],Somethin bout the goldie in me,Somethin bout an oakland mack,When I hear this song,It makes an o.g. feel phat,[Verse 1; Hammer],Somethin bout the goldie in me,That makes me laugh at these wannabes,Cause they been watchin too much tv,Rambo and clint eastwood got ya trippin,But the goldie in me, Keeps me thinkin bout my group and never slippin,In that played out tread, Cause most o.g.'s are in the pen or fresh out,And when I hear rappers like you call me wack,I laugh and just say over twenty million sold, Can you buy that?,Yeah, Fake rappers are surreal,You don't hear me though, I thought ya knew,I'm a certified player, You see,Cause of the girls, The girls, They love me,And no matter what my critics say,They all know that I'm mackin this fame,Cause fools can't recognize game,I refuse to be a wannabe,Somethin bout the goldie in me, Yeah,Chorus 2x,[Verse 2; Hammer],Somethin bout the goldie in me, See I'm a g,Hangin wit fools like Big loose, Crossecuse, And killa week,Just some hard knunkleheads from the eastside,Where we used to squab, Shoot em down, Collect ends, And high side and rise,And get between thighs on the day to day,Craps, Big bank take little bank, Were games we like to play,Rollin down east 14, The brothers be trippin, They hear the cats be slippin,Cause the moves be quick to zippin,Pickin up freaks every other block, Wherever the ride stop,The girls flock, And all the homies jock, Sock,Bustas makin smart remarks, I'm quick to bust ya,Never worry about my back, Because I'm rollin wit some hustlas,And we don't sell, We bail,Creep through the hood wit pockets fatter than the goodyear blimp,Yeah, An oaktown player, G,It's got to be the goldie in me,Chorus 2x

Why o Why, why?,We used to play games all night long now all my loved 1's are gone This ain't even cool it ain't even cool,Now I'm gonna tell you how it all got started. We was all young hard headed & broken hearted got caught up in the game, caught up in the hustle next thing you know we comin' with the muscle. Respect for the streets was invented in our souls but that's the way you moved if you wanted to grow old. Sooner or later somebody always caught a case but we was like A students in your mama's face. We knew the rules, respect for the king. My o My how the good can change Every fool you know saying Keep it Real but we was still real w/out our steel. 1 on 1, man to man & after we scrapped we shook hands, for the good of the hood & the hood was good that's what really? we misunderstood?,What happened to our hood?,It used to be all good.,Now everything is out of control.,It hurts me deep inside to see our people dying. Why o Why, why?,We used to play games all night long now all my loved 1's are gone This ain't even cool it ain't even cool,Now every little thug wanna try to get stripes, but you ain't a man cause ya stole somebody's life, cause there's a bullet with your name on it another young thug wants stripes don't you know it. The world is mad (hardest?) on our kids babies in the ground even tho they could live. Dead and gone in their teenage years by the hands of their peers. The memories so vivid & clear, we'll be missing you for years, we'll be missing you with tears, we'll be wishing you were here. Life & pain they're 1 and the same & all of our lives we'll speak your name. It hurts deep to know that you are gone, it hurts me to have to sing this song.,What happened to our hood?,It used to be all good.,Now everything is out of control.,It hurts me deep inside to see our people dying. Why o Why, why?,We used to play games all night long now all my loved 1's are gone This ain't even cool it ain't even cool,I gotta move on but moving is hard & I gotta think because of this I found God. Our world will never be the same. My heart will always know the pain and my lips will always speak your name, your face I'll see in the rain. I miss you, miss you, I'll miss you now and for always.,What happened to our hood?,It used to be all good.,Now everything is out of control.,It hurts me deep inside to see our people dying. Why o Why, why?,We used to play games all night long now all my loved 1's are gone This ain't even cool it ain't even cool
