Spreadin' rumors, tellin' lies,I'm real sensitive to the fact,Of why must you go out like that,You can't say nothin' positive,All I get are negative responses,They say it's hard to keep a good man down,But it's not hard to have one up off the ground,He said, she said, this-n-that,But who's tellin' the truth?  It ain't like that,I knew somethin' was wrong, I knew it all along,But nobody told me what was goin' on,So just STOP ... all this disrespect,'Cause now is the time for me to put you in check,They say the truth hurts, but don't get mad at me,I'm talkin' to those who got larceny,Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice,Larceny, meaning bein' jealous-hearted,Over little or nothin', it can get started,For example, a man wants to get ahead,Others wish he failed and rather see him dead,Always puttin' obstacles in your path,It becomes a problem you shouldn't have,It's like a disease spreadin' faster than AIDS,The word is out, they misspelled your name,People look at you a little strange,You gain more foes as your lifestyle change',They want what you got, that's the dollars that you clock,To you it's petty but to them it's a lot,Material things they couldn't retain,Still hopin' your loss will be their gain,Yet we strive to stay alive and live carefree,Others still have that larceny,Verse 3, You'll shake my hand, pretend to be my friend,And behind my back, wish it all would end,People mention my name, you'll frown your face,Hopin' in your dreams you'll take my place,The things that I own you wish you had,Every time I do good it makes you mad,You're not a friend to me, just an enemy,A sucker that rhymes, a wanna be, You wanna be like me, only in your dreams,You wanna be down, but you gotta come clean,Rockin' boomin' beats on every cut,2 Live's in effect, why you sweatin' us?,Wishin' you had all the money I've made,And all the females that I've slayed,You hate me, boy, now ain't that a pity,You ain't got the vapors, you got larceny

NO DATE 2 Live Crew:Mamalopenga,2 Live Crew,",Verse One: Brother Marquis,I bumped into her at the Coco Cabana,Down in Cuban town in little Havana,I asked her her name, she said Juanita,I just had to ask cuz I just had to meet her,I heard of fast girls but she's a speeder,She said she was hungry and told me to feed her,So I got an expresso and a hot burrito,You look so sweet you fine senorita,Mamalopenga, mama sita,It's a black thing baby so you know it's sweeter,Okay Juanita now I must be your guy,She said Juanita's my nickname, call me Spanish fly,,Verse Two: Fresh Kid Ice,Black girls white girls even Puerto Ricans,But the Mexicans and Cubans are all so freakin',I like 'em in dresses with big 'ole chesses,I also like the style and the way she impresses,The fragrance of her perfume smells like roses,She's guarenteed to turn heads whenever she poses,She lives in Miami and of Latin descent,And being with her is how my time should be spent,I met her in the berries on a Friday night,Dressed in a soft silky dress colour virgin white,I said ""hey pretty lady, just suck on my finger,And tonight you're the one to Mamalopenga"",
