1995,Master P,"It's 1995, alot of brothers done died,Alot sisters, them mothers, them fathers,And aunties, and grandma's done left to cry,Now he nothing but a memory, used to be a friend of me,Said he'd never die, but now he's six feet deep,With a tombstone, oh my god my brother's gone,And I don't even even think I can go on,Cause it hurts,To lose someone you love to this madness,And killing, murder, shoot-em-up, this game of drugs,Doctors pumped his chest, my daddy said let him rest,A team rolled up and put him to his final test,Hands got cold, God rest his soul ,He walked out his body to another another episode,Then the window opened ,Then they put him in the final frontier ,You know what happened in the end,Chorus:,I wish I could've seen him before he died ,But when they gone, that's when we realized,I wish I could've seen him before he died ,But when they gone, that's when we realized,Front, back, side-to-side,But who will be the next victim to roll in that black ride,Front, back, side-to-side,It might be you,The next victim to ride in that black ride,Just another homicide for the West County Times ,Fools gettin' took out the game at the at the drop of a dime,The game's gettin' deep, I toss in my sleep ,But would a young young live to see 2-3,Killin' don't fase, fools think i'm crazy,Muslims on every corner, handin' out black daisies ,Name scratched off the wall, ain't no final call,Used to slang bean pies, now it's 'bout that white ball,Only fifteen, already got fiends,And workin' the ghetto like Jack Stalk could work some beans,Livin' off a high, gold ones on his ride,Bitches on his side, but only livin' to retire,Ain't that a shame, took him out the game ,Same fool he used to roll with, yelled out his name ,Popped in his chest, didn't wear his vest,Some day his kid took his first step, he took his last breath,Chorus,Who's under the white sheet,Somebody bring the yellow tape ,The ghetto took him under, today will be a sad day,Ain't no time to cry, no time to shed no tears,You know the way he died, the same way he lived,Who was his killer, found him dead on his knees,Same room with his wife, and his kid left to grieve,Hopin' that this is a nightmare, one pop and he's outta there ,God rest his soul, left his kid in a wheelchair,Scared for his life, his daddy took the ghetto flight ,And at the funeral, momma said boy you know it's gonna be alright,But know he's gone, ain't nobody to run his home,Another kingpin, stripped from the ghetto throne,Lost at the game of life, ain't no time to think twice,The same fool he trusted, and I sleeps with his wife,Tagged his toe, strapped him in the ziplock ,Another another flip-flopped, pop was slangin' that crack rock,Now he's gone, Amazing Grace his last song,Six ballers carried him out the church, took take his his home,4 limos, 3 Cutlass, 2 El Doggs, a cop and the hearse ,Everybody had they lights on,And when the straps pops to lower him down in the grave,See it was sad the way his his family misbehaved,His family cryin', but everybody gots to die,But you won't feel what they feel,'Till somebody in your family dies,Chorus

1991,Master P,",This is station KMLN,And we're sitting here with rap star Master P,Leader of The Real Untouchables,Master P, where are you from?,,The ghetto,,Now that you are living in Beverly Hills,Has anything changed?,,Well...not really,,Master P, would you like to say anything to the people,Who think that you couldn't make it?,,Yeah, fuck em',,So Master P, what's life to you?,,Life to me ain't nothing but bitches and money,,Life..life...life...life,Life...ain't...nothing...but...b-bitch...bitches and money,,Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money ,Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money ,,It all started way back in the day,When this bitch named Brenda used to give a nigga hay,So just listen to the words I say,And if you a man you've experienced foul play,You know the hoes, the ones that act funny,That don't say shit till ya whip out some money,Then a bitch start jockin',Next thing ya know ya at the hotel rockin',I can't have a bitch cause we didn't have no money you was a trip,So you makin' that mail, it's kind of risky,You thinkin' fuck she thinkin' rags to the riches,So this the shit you gotta beat,Meet a freak before ya fall for another man's freal,But if ya laugh, ain't a damn thing funny,Cause ya like P, life ain't nothin' but bitches and money,,,I'm the K-I-N-G, don't avenge me,Don't think cause I'm stingy,I want cash, I don't flash,Ask my bitch, fuck the dash,Rollin' in the street in a fresh ass Rolls,Checkin' out the bitches and the funky hoes,Ooh who is this behind the tinted glass,A bitch named Gina wanna give me some ass,Well next week call the honey,Cause life ain't nothin' but bitches and money,,,My Vette, clean as shit,I see some hoes lookin' they wanna ride in it,Bitches think a nigga can tap for some ass,Open like a fuckin' convertible runs off of gas,So open on up and start pumpin',Cause that don't be workin' hoes get something for nothin',Man life ain't nothin' but bitches and money,,,I love money...and bitches too,The ones as sweet as honey,But when she fucks up, she's gotta go,Don't let her stay but the cash flow,I could give a damn about a stupid ho,Bitch ya can't make me rich this I know,This is behind me,I need big dollars and fuckin' thick bitch behind me,And I'ma get them to thinkin' hope,But I ain't fuckin' with em' if they broke,Cause money attracts money,And when ya ain't got none all ya days are funny,Just like my boys said,When ya got a pocket full of money,Everything is funny,Ain't that the truth Ruth,With a pocket full of dough fuck a bitch, hella fun,And afterwards she will cease,All I care about is bitches and money,,,I think it's all types of games bein' played,But to a bitch these days the looks ain't shit,Unless these niggas pay,Look here bro' ya gotta suffer,Cause a motherfucker with trues and Vogues got all the hoes,Don't even cuss, she think a nigga is hustle,The more ya make the more she take,Bring her to dinner think of dessert,Come up with an empty plate,This to them young hoes,There's money, meals, and haves,This another way ya feel up Mike and Thomas and rock Ruth,So don't take it personal hoes just keep runnin',And to the fellas out there, you know how it goes,Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money

1991,Master P,"Sittin in the project tryin to get my game on,Fuck these hoes they just ding-dongs,Mama need shoes,The baby need milk so I got to get strapped with a 9,For some bull shit rollin hard hittin 711's,1 punk wanted to bet so nip him with a 7,Break these fools so my banks gettin bigger,Pull out my 9 here comes some jealous niggaz,But I really don't give a fuck,Ready to take a motherfucker out if he try to press his luck,Ask one of them hoes what the fuck are ya lookin at,I knew he was a punk ,Cause a nigga step back ready to leave the motherfuckin game,Walkin with a lean ya know what I'm sayin?,Never them motherfuckers broke but I ain't no joke,Potnahs are clean ya know,Rollin' the dice...
