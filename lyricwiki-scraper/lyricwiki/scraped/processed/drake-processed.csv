NO DATE Drake:With You,Drake,",Shawty badder than a 3 year old,Keep playing and imma eat her like a pita roll,Im just sayin with my love I could feed her soul,Two day getaway and we dont need our clothes,We at the pool and she lookin like a center fold,Two tattoos but she say she gettin plenty mo,She got Indian in her family, seminol,Me and shawty go together like chemicals,And she get mad when I call other woman hoes,You send a rose, I pick some flowers and send her those,Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode,Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe,I whisper in her ear, than lick around her lobe,And when she check her watch, it's never time to go,And with her brain she should make the honor roll,And when I came, she caught me like the common cold.,,God damn you the sh-t,And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the sh-t,And I dont really know how to handle this sh-t,But tonight its moonlight and candles and sh-t,With you baby,With you baby,With you baby,With you baby,With youuuu and only you,,Uh I say damn I must be left cause you the best I ever seen right,Shawty put me on, you got me gone like some green lights,See you with your girls, they probably telling that he aint right,Bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice,Lets get together over night,Shawty im a pro and you are lookin like the protoype,But see that I took your advice,,Sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice,Im crusin on the road of life but I need a passenger,Appettite for lovin, ma im hungry like a scavenger,I-I be on that lavender,I-I be in the bath with her,Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner,,God damn you the sh-t,And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the sh-t,And I dont really know how to handle this sh-t,But tonight its moonlight and candles and sh-t,With you baby,With you baby,With you baby,With you baby,With youuuu and only you,,Now she dont know about me,But Imma put her on it,And she aint show up out me,But cant go without me,We probably aint supposed to be together,But I wonder if our love affair her could last forever,And shawty Im with ya,Smoke alot of weed but I could never forget ya,Then I told her to her face,,If everyone was like you the World would be a better place,,God damn you the sh-t,And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the sh-t,And I dont really know how to handle this sh-t,But tonight ........ its moonlight and candles and sh-t,With you baby,With you baby,With you baby,With you baby,With youuuu and only you,.*lyrics by *==> Ladeey G

So many different choices,Too many different opinions, too many different voices,What am I afriad of, just to say love?,I love you baby but, this is what I'm made of,And I'ma be me, cause I can't be no other,So I don't know if Aaliyah's gettin a little brother,But all I know is I already got one baby mother,And that's too much trouble, sorry I can't love you,,What am I afraid of?,This is supposed to be what dreams are made of,But people I don't have the time to hang with,Always look at me and say the same shit,They say - you promised me you would never change,Ohh, oh oh, ohh, oh oh, ohh,You promised me you would never change,Ohh, oh oh, ohh, oh oh, ohh ,,Uhh, am I wrong for makin light of my situation?

2011,Drake,",If you was in a pine box,I would surely break the lock,I’d jump right in and fall asleep,Cause you are the death of me,,Looking in the mirror I’m embarrassed,I’m feeling like a suicidal terrorist,React like an infant whenever you are mentioned,Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis,I’m in the matter of man arm wrestling,Hands I was dealt when I said the music business was all I needed,When I got it I was greeted by an alien,That said last year that she slept with a Canadian,That gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz,Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend,My vice is similar women love when you're my type,And you're winning from everything that your palm write,Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city,Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel,Live the ambiance all cause the audience,One day said I would do it,So instead of a verse being read,I'mma go and get some head off the strength of my music,I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat,Capitalize That, and your weave look good with the Indian tracks,Tracking device on your used 5 series,I don’t call back just blame it on your Canadian,The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto,Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word,Like the rappers I know,Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can’t see us,A white waitress on standby when we need her,A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep,No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah,Felt like the initiation,A reality living in the matrix,We talk casually about the industry,And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we making,Then he said that he was the same age as myself,And it didn’t help cause it made me even more rude an impatient,So blame it on Mr. OVOXO, the reason why I’m breathing all the vanity I know,The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life,But I live a double life and need to let her go,The reason why, the highlight was when he said:,You belong to the people when you outside,So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame,And bury yourself alive, then I died

2010,Drake,"Things have been so crazy and hectic,I should have gotten back by now,But you know how much I wanted to make it,It's probably better anyhow,So if you gotta go,If there's anything I should know,If the spotlight makes you nervous,If you're looking for a purpose,You put the tea in the kettle and light it,Put your hand on the metal and feel it,But do you even feel it anymore,I remember when you thought I was joking,Now I'm all singing karaoke,Further than I've ever been,So if you gotta go,If there's any way I can help,Isn't it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner,That tells 'em my life is too much and moves to Atlanta,Damn, of all the places you could go,I just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know,I always up too late I worry bout you there alone,In that place you call your home,Warm nights and cold patron,I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy,'Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories 'bout his lady,I know they say the first love is the sweetest,But that first cut is the deepest,I tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets,Secrets you were telling everybody but me,Don't be fooled by the money I'm still young and just unlucky,I'm surprised you couldn't tell,I was only trying to get ahead,I was only trying to get ahead,But the spotlight makes you nervous,And you're looking for a purpose,I was only trying to get ahead,I was only trying to get ahead,But the spotlight makes you nervous,And you're looking for a purpose
