Hot shots,Would wanna spend those five digit o's, on bimbo's,Bar closed, back to her six double o, she drove,My eyes closed her nigga dozed, when I awoke,Saw mad snow, we at her spot at the Poconos,Bridge robes, crib hot as a stove,She changed out of her clothes, put on a silky bath robe,Panty hoes with see thru holes, pretty toes,Took me into the master suite, shit was sweet,Jacuzzi four feet deep, with satin sheets,As I was speaking to this half black/latin freak,Met on a Manhatten street, body petite, fat on the cheeks,I was getting open, started laughing and joking,We weed smoking, stroking, the shorty's spoke and,Said what the deal is, the realness ,My man is crazy as Bruce Willis,If he catches us, he'll try to kill us,He got a whole army of Kiiers,Me no worry, I got the clapper son,End of the first verse, chapter one,Word,Shit is real in the field,Thug love story,,So here I am,Laid up in this lavish house, up in the Poconos,With this chick I don't even really know,Steady stressing me how ill her man is,So what I go and do, heh-heh, I nail her ass to the bed anyway,Straight twisting mami's back out,Hit three o'clock, fell right the fuck to sleep,Clothes still on, breath smelling like Henrock,Totally no kind of regards for this bitch's man,I guess it's just another one of those G Rap adventures,,The next day about a quarter to eight,I heard a squeek on the staircase,Got the gat from under the pillow case,Somebody broke in, now me and boo fully awoken,Good thing I slept inside my clothes and shorty was frozen,I'm waiting for a head to poke in, and start smoking,The home invasion, right through the door, he started blazing,Bullets was grazing, shit was crazy and,I had to think to fast, let the gun blast, duck, then dash,Heard a crash, they broke through the door, they on her ass,Jumped off the balcony like a falcon Gee,With honey right in back of me, feel on top of the snow in agony,Shit was thick, couldn't get to the six, they loaded the fifth,Saw the snowmobile yo fuck it,We start jumped it, get on top of the shit and peeled,Mad soldiers out in the field, busting they steel,The raw deal, kill or be killed, shit is real,Ten hit me right on my heels, trying to make a thugs blood spill,In zero degrees, niggas on skis, me and these Gees,Slipping through pine trees, we skid up behind these,Two big rocks and left off shots, about four dropped,The other six started to pop, I feel something hot,I think I got hit, my jacket is ripped,Loaded my last clip then broke out quick and checked the chick,She on my back tighter than shit, like vise grips,I started clapping, niggas rolled up in blowing black and,Spotted this Rover by a log cabin, we got our as in,Mash the gas, make the fucking wheel spin,The safety again, and still doing a hundred and ten,Shorty shivering, lips quivering, ski suits up in the back seat,Pulled over the Jeep get it in,And took a rest stop at the river bend,We living, we made it the fuck out, mad slugs delivering,Pretty soon we at my rest piece, up in the bedroom,Got shorty boo tending my bullet wound,Put on some tunes, she blew my shit like a balloon,Up in the moonlit room, and dicking her womb,Hitting full behind her, grinding her with my anaconda,She rode the dick like a honda,I took her to the point of no return like Bridgette Fonda,She back spasmed, giving the crazy orgasm, from steady rhythm,My dick glistened, her lips hit'em, I shot jism,Then laid back in the sack and lit the ism,I thought about the realism,Niggas coming and bring they steel with them,I got just the thing to deal with them,Nickel plate Mac, the laser attached, with two clips packed,Push a niggas whole head back, so I snatched that,So quick spread out and play the layout,Still on alert, me and the skirt, day in and day out,,Yo what's the matter mami, you scared or something?,,I'm a little worried baby,,Yo, don't be worried about nothing, alright,Everything is gonna be alright,,OK,,Look, we just gonna go to your house, go get the money,You know, we gonna get your backs or whatever,And we gonna get out of there, alright?,,Alright, ven paca papi, dame un besito,,Alright, grab that bag money,,Let's do this, baby,,After three whole days of lamping, we broke camp and,Went out to the beach, many mansions out in the Hamptons,Brung the clamp, ready to shoot shit up at random,Five hundred grand is buried in the sand,We planning, up in the crib-o with big windows, I'm counting the dough,She packing her clothes, had her Lexus in the back of the Rolls,I saw the keys, I grabbed the G's, we on and took those,Shit was sitting on some chrome momo's,Tinted windows, a LS Ford double O,Told the chick, yo you moving to slow,Speed it up baby, we got to go,And get this plane and hit the Caymans,With the payment, somebody came in,A platoon of goons with heaters aiming,I drew the Mac 10 and started flaming, they did the same and,Slugs spraying and blood raining, I left about seven thugs laying,But this one cat was gaining, he grab the dame and,Put the heater to the chicks brain and,I let my two guns drop, they got the drop,They took us both to a boat dock, then on a yacht,The chick's man was there with a sixteen shot,Nigga was hot, took the glock and hit me dead in my knot,Honey started to panic and yelling that money in spanish,Thinking he's out to take advantage,So we're out in the fucking Atlantic,With no lifesavers and stranded,Backhanded the chick on the floor, called her a whore,Said, ""amor you won't be pretty no more"",Took us on a tour, down in the deck,Guess he wasn't ready to kill us yet,Saw this nigga there, holding the Tec,Ready to wet, I'm started to sweat, a niggas stressed,We up beside a horrible mess,I saw a box with the letters on it S.O.S,So I took out a flare gun and shot the kid in the chest,Took the Tec from out his hand, now I'm ready to bless,The madness, put the rest of them niggas to rest,Looked around, the chick's man was the only one left,Threw his ass over board and told him hold your breath,Caught my breath, I seen honey down on the deck,Eyes closed with a bullet hole dead in her breast,Held her in my arms till her soul finally left,I'm mad depressed, my baby was an innocent death,A real thug lost the only women he loved,And I bugged, busting slugs at the stars above,Word

Who's bustin bigger caps?,My BOOM BOOM BOOMS against they PAP PAP PAPS,No haps, G. Rap ain't goin out like a sucker,I reloaded the shot and dropped another motherfucker,Quick, I duck and shit to dodge the bullets comin at me,Cause I won't be too happy with a slug inside my nappy,Two more niggaz left, they scared to death, but I'm leary,Shit gets kinda scary when I got bulletholes near me,I went between two cars, lettin off the quarter pound,I see another body fallin down to the ground,Quick I run up on him cause I don't think that he's dead,Standin over his ass I put two more inside his head,That's three niggaz down, only got one nigga to go,I gots to send his ass to the gravedigger so,I lay low in the cut and wait for moneygrip to slip up,Nearly shot my whole clip up, I got one more slug to rip up,Look over by the GS, see his ass stickin his head out,Boom, let the lead out, blew a piece of his brain dead out,the back of his head, now he's dead, because he fell face down,right on the motherfuckin streets that he dwelled,Chorus 2.5X
