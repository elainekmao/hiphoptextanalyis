That's how I'm going out,,For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out,Niggaz start to mumble, ,They want to rumble ,Mix them and cook them in a pot like Gumbo.,Going off on a motherfucker like that,,With a gat that's pointed at your ass. ,So give it up smooth.,Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move.,Here's a murder rap to keep ya dancing,,With a crime record like Charles Manson.,AK-47 is the tool.,Don't make me act a motherfucking fool.,Me and you can go toe to toe, no maybe,,I'm knocking niggaz out the box daily.,Yo weekly, monthly, and yearly,,Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly,That I'm down with the capital C-P-T.,Boy, you can't fuck with me.,So when I'm in your neighborhood, ,You better duck,,'cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck.,As I leave, believe I'm stomping,But when I come back, boy, ,I'm coming straight outta Compton.,VERSE 2  ,,Straight outta Compton,,Another crazy ass nigga.,More punks I smoke, ,Yo my rep gets bigger.,I'm a bad motherfucker and you know this,,But the pussy ass niggaz won't show this.,But I don't give a fuck, I'mma make my snaps,,If not from the records, from jacking, or craps. ,It's like burglary, the definition is jacking,,Or when illegally armed, it's called packing.,Shoot a motherfucker in a minute,,I find a good piece of pussy, and go up in it.,So if you're at a show in the front row, ,I'mma call you a bitch or a dirty ass 'ho.,You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to,,But that shows me what you're composed to ,A crazy motherfucker from the street.,Attitude legit, 'cause I'm tearing up shit.,MC Ren controls the automatic,For any dumb motherfucker that starts static.,Not the right hand, 'cause I'm the hand itself, ,Every time, I pull a AK off the shelf.,Security is maximum and that's a law.,R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw.,See, 'cause I'm the motherfucking villain.,The definition is clear, ,You're the witness of a killing,That's taking place without a clue.,And once you're on the scope, ,Your ass is through.,Look, you might take it as a trip,,But a nigga like Ren is on a gangster tip. ,Straight outta Compton.,VERSE 3  ,,Straight outta Compton,,Is a brother that'll smother your mother,And make your sister think I love her.,Dangerous motherfucker raising hell,,And if I ever get caught I make bail.,See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem.,I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him, ,But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while,,And when I see the punk pass, I smile.,To me it's kind of funny, ,The attitude is showing;,Nigga driving,,But don't know where the fuck he going.,Just rolling,,Looking for the one they call Eazy,,But here's the flash:  They never seize me.,Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark,,Except when I unload.

Fuck her!,You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker.,This is an autobiography of the E ,And if you ever fuck with me,You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother.,Word to the motherfucker.,Straight outta Compton. ,Damn, that shit was dope!,---NOTES---, ""jacking the cracks"" a lyric that appears in some transcriptions, seems nonsensical, as does ""jacking the crops."" The lyric ""Jacking, or craps "" seems improved because it's consistent with the idea that 'Ruthless Villain' MC Ren would make money from his records, or from stealing and gambling.  Having more industry than agriculture, it is unlikely that Ren is robbing farmers of their crops in Compton.  :P, The current lyric ""what you're composed to"" doesn't make much sense.  And, this transcriber hears the word ""slut"" instead of ""what"", although that doesn't clarify the rest of the sentence., Possibly ""it's fun to jump over a hesitation"" or ""a spark will jump over a hesitation"" or ""a spark can jump over a hesitation.""  This transcriber recalls a printed interview with NWA where they clarified this line with ""spark,"" but the transcriber's ancient memory is not sufficient for good data, and the meaning of this line is still not clear., This transcriber is positing that the lyric goes: ""and hear the scream of the one who caught the leg penetration,"" ie., bullet wound.  This transcriber can imagine an S phoneme just before ""penetration,"" but the transcriber suspects that it might be a phantom phoneme from the 808 hi-hat.  Also the meaning of ""last penetration"" is not understood.
