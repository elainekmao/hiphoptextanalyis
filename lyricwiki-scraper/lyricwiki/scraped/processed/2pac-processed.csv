wonderin what she do,Fucked around and gave me that pussy too,I be doin this shit on a regular basis,Got bitches everywhere in all kind of places,I can pull out my little black phone book,Flip every last page take a long look,Than pull out a bitch, like a rabbit out a hat,Nigga if I want, I can have it like that,Fuck two or three bitches at the same time,Grab the microphone sing my rhyme,About them same three bitches that fucked me good,Us niggas gotta do what the fuck we should when we want to ,I might pass it,So get butt naked, shake that ass bitch,I'm bout as real as the stones in my diamond rings,You can hate my guts, but I'm gone do these things, bitch,,Ahhh why have a nine, when I can have a ten,Lickin up the nuts, while I'm gone holler at her friend,Bitch, ain't no time for me to teach her,Rather have an everyday hoe, that umm knows how to treat a nigga,Thinkin if she ain't lickin me up,I'm givin her to Short, cause he don't give a fuck,Do yourself a favor and quit callin my house,If you really don't want this nigga to put this dick in your mouth,Umm, have you seen my bitch?,I ain't seen her, but if i do she gets dick,That's what I'm givin her just like that,To the front and back, nothing but the bozack,The second she get lonely, feelin she can get her money,And she run to fuck her own ignorant homey,You a lost cause, yellin pause when they drop the draws,Its's entrapment, have yo nigga breakin nigga laws,But it ain't a matter of mentality, it's reality,Open your eyes, realize bitches ain't nothin but a casuality,But a factor to a nigga wanting fuckin time,She's just an everday, don't wanna catch a fuckin ?mime?,Bitch ain't lieing, so I thought you knew this,Bitch this is how I do this,,You can call eight ball in the corner when you shootin pool,But when you play the game of life, ain't no stupid rules,Gotta go for yours at all times,Cause if you don't, nigga yours will be mine,And I won't go to bed early, won't sleep too late,And I'll never take a punk ass bitch on a date,They say Too Short baby why you talk so bad?,Just a player ass nigga and that's all I rap about,Bitches, hoes and all that shit,She got my number, if she beep me I might call the bitch,And go diggin in them guts like a gardener,If she starts screamin, I'm gone fuck the hoe harder,Just havin fun with the bitch, as she sprung on my dick,Guess I'll pull it out and just cum on the bitch,And from New Year's Day to New Year's Eve,And everyday in between I will do these things, I won't stop bitch,,I like to go to the club mix and mingle,Nigga plays his dick like a 12 inch single,Yeah, so what you bitches wanna do?,Step to me you gots to do my crew, first,When I rehearse I change rearrange,My mentality will bring you to reality,You on me like cologne 'til now,I feel it's time for us to bone so I,Look and pimp the background,Look, listen put the bitch on lockdown,See you hangin out with me tonight,Everythings alright, but a nigga wanna fight,Damn, that's a real player hater for ya,Fuck it, I'll be waitin for ya,,I'm droppin lines like a mother fuckin pimp at this shit,I'm gettin hoes out they clothes cause i'm good at this shit,They callin me the pussy jammer cause I'm breakin hoes off,See i'm paid to be boss, I'm kickin back at no cost,Never slackin, just mackin, money stackin that's my motto,With so much game they want to play me like the lotto,Tip the bottle, now I'm drunk as a skunk,High off the dank, but I can't front,See I'm never being senile,See I'm smooth as a nail on a fingernail file,Keepin it wild, but in the meanwhile we the coolest,Sure enough this how we do this,,I'm fingerfuckin with my,Now they peepin how a nigga climb on the chart,Ain't fear in my heart, I represent it from the start,Deep, my momma raised me as a g from birth,Be a hustlin motherfucker 'til I sees my hearse,No doubt, I bust a shot for all my niggaz in jail,All the young black males, that got slang yell,Cause its a hard life nigga only thugs survive,Ain't no love, unless a nigga slangin drugs or high,Conversations with these bitches on my mobil,Always in control and never let these bitches know ya,And even though I'm gettin high, a thug nigga gettin by,Catchin bitches spittin lies, I'm gettin mine,All day, I puff a blunt and parlay and sometimes if we party,Gettin my dick licked twice,And death to a trick's life, we can pursue this 'til my shit's right,Went from havin fantasies, to havin hoes leave they man for me,There is no realer man than me,The city of Oaktown laced me with my first case,When them punk police tried to break

Save your sympathy,My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary,Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe,If you believe then you can achieve,Just look at me,Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on,Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on,To all the seeds that follow me,protect your essence,Born with less, but you still precious,Just smile for me now,Chours: Johnny P, 2Pac,Smiiiiiile for me , won't you smile ,Just smiiiile , smile for me,,Smiiiiiile for me ,Won't you smile  just smiiiiile,,Verse Two: Scarface,Now as I open up my story,with the blaze a your blunts,And you can picture thoughts slowly,up on phrases I wrote,And I can walk you through the days that I done,I often wish that I could save everyone,but I'm a dreamer,Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game,overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came?,Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain,Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine,To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain,And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane,Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change,But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains,Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big,And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child,All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile,Smile,Chorus ,Verse Three: 2Pac,Fuck the world as we Unload and witness furious speeds,of nasty questions keep us all stressin', curious G's,Backstabbed and bleedin', fuckin' thoughts laced with weed,Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin' ,Inhalin' sherm smoke, visualized the flames,Will I be smothered by my own pain?,Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us,Takin' pictures for the feds, and desperate hopes they'd get us,Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins,Since I ain't in many penitenturies the best revenge is fuck friends,We military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly,Tryin' to find Jehovah to help me,Somebody save me,Lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies,Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain,embrace my words make the world change,And still I smile nigga,,And now a moment of silence, let us pray,And as you journey into outerspace ,may the angels help to lead the way,May the prayers that our families made,shine up on your soul to keep you safe,And all the homies that done passed away,They there to greet you as you pass the gates,And as you headed to the tunnel's light,I hope it leads to eternal life,We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac,Smile,,,,

Bow, bow, don't run up on it,The same thing minus P hangin possies like an exponent,Oh yes, rock in slums, ya gots to run it,It makes no sense to smell like shit,If old ass George could be Washing-tons,,,Now I be loyal to my niggas on the blocks, just buckin the shots,And packin the glocks,and dodgin the cops, and takin over niggas spots,Poppin after poppin the fools be droppin, the hoes be hoppin,On my thing cause it hangs like the nets from Above the Rim,You lookin grim, is it me or him or him,Or be with me, we be together,So what's up? We can do whatever,Cause real niggas stick together ,Till they make it up to heaven,Through the stress, through the hell, through the 1-8-7,The shorter the nigga, the bigga the trigga,The deeper they dig the ditch-a,The Naughty the Treach,then through to the Pac I brings the glock I wets up,You fuckin body, I'm like, Oh my Gody,Did I really shoot him? Yo I shot him,So got him, now I puts the crime behind me,And finds me, a place to lays my head low,I lives doin my rap, but I dies for my hood row,So all you fuckin fools better recognize, and know my fuckin name,I be Riddler to my niggas and I'm loyal to the game,

My words to my first born,... My words to my first born,,Since my very first day on this earth, I was cursed,So I knew, that the birth of a child would make my life worse,And though it hurt me there was no distortion,Cause wild seeds can't grow, we need more abortions,Quiet your soul, cause you know what you had to do,And so did victims of a world they never came to,I understand it's a better day comin,Sometimes cats be sleepin on the dead end,Drivin with the car runnin blinded,Ain't no love in the hood only hearts torn,Love letters to the innocent and unborn,All the babies that died up on the table,Wasn't able to breathe, cause the family wasn't able,Can't - blame her I would do the same,All I could give it was my debt and my last name,Cause in the game things change livin up and down,This hard life got me walkin with my head down,Flashin frowns wasn't meant to be, was I wrong?,But I'll never get to know, so I carry on,It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born,My words to my first born, feel me,... My words to my first born,... Mmm!  These are the words to my first born,... Hey nigga talk to your born, talk to your seed nigga,,Two thousand somethin somethin it's a new era,A nigga's too real, now see shit too clear,See there's more than just this scrilla and this tilt,,The velvet and the silk, and makin sure my kittens got they milk, Gotta fill this mattress, let my kids know I'm at this,Attack this, the Mack must roll, hood stroll,Ain't no question is it? Above the Law hustlers,If it's related to chips, homey we'll handle ya,Yo...,Although we never take advantage though we always into ery'thang,By all means, stack green, gangsta lean,They say money make the world go 'round,So only 'ssociate yourself with paper chasers,And niggaz that's truly down - and keep God first,And give thanks for the good times, as well as when it hurts,It's player haters every corner you hit,Touchin their tits, hella thick, tryin to get you for yo' grip,I know you stressed out and fed up,But come out, gun - blazin, and keep yo' head up,You can call it what you want to but it ain't gon' change,Above the Law, 2Pac, O. G. 's in this rap game,And we done lived a long hard life,And we done shed so many tears under these bright lights,Y'all, although we grew up, corrupted and scorned,We still got a lot of wisdom, to give to our first born,,What you gon' tell your kids nigga?,Who was you? What was you doin? How did you put it down?,These my words to my motherfuckin first born,So they can know, y'knahmean? Hehehe,Ain't nuttin but a motherfuckin rider, Wessyde 'til I die,That's all it was, it's a crooked - ass hand they deal a motherfucker,I just played to win, just played to win,Motherfucker gotta bet agains the odds...

Boo-yaow!,,,There's no way to survive in the city it's a shame,Niggaz die from my hollow-point bullet to the brain,Will I survive or will I die is what I wonder,Puffin on blunts and gettin drunk to keep from goin under,Gettin lost in the madness, blunted gettin tipsy,Got my pistol out the window screamin, ""Lord come and get me"",Am I sick, or am I just another victim?,Unloadin my clip, I'm watchin every bullet spit when I kick em,Niggaz die from automatic gunfire,Your time to expire, nobody cry every man gotta die,When they bury me, they bury me a G,Rest in peace, to all the homies got to heaven before me,Pour some liquor on the curb for the niggaz that's caught,Had a motherfuckin ward but he didn't go to court,God damn, and one day we'll all be together,Until then I'm ready for whatever, c'mon,,,Am I going to Hell or will I reach Heav-en? ,After all this shit I did with my Mac-11,Did I sell my soul? Mama woulda saved me,That's the way that daddy raised me,Oh God, help me I'm losin it,So fuck it! Take me I'm doin it!,I need to change and look for a better way,I got a hundred round clip to my AK,Commitin sins I might die in vain,So fuck it!
