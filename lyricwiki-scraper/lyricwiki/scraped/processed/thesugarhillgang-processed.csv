1980,The Sugarhill Gang,"I said-a hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie,To the hip hip hop-a you don't stop the rock,It to the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat,Now what you hear is not a test, I'm rappin' to the beat,And me, the groove and my friends are gonna try to move your feet,See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say hello,To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow,But first I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie,Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,Let's rock, you don't stop,Rock the riddle that will make your body rock,Well, so far youve heard my voice, but I brought two friends along,And next on the mic is my man Hank: come on, Hank, sing that song,Check it out: I'm the C-a-s-an-the-o-v-a, and the rest is f-l-y,Y'see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons, I'll tell ya why:,Y'see I'm six-foot-one and I'm tons of fun, and I dress to a T,Y'see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously,I got bodyguards, I got two big cars that definitely ain't the wack,I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac,So after school, I take a dip in the pool which is really on the wall,I got a color TV, so I can see the Knicks play basketball,Hear me talkin' 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend,But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the rucker, not a dime till I made it again,Y'go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? ,Y'say I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spankin', drive off in a def OJ,Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn,Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend,Master Gee, am I mellow?,It's on you, so what you gonna do?,Well, it's on n on n on on n on,The beat don't stop until the break of dawn,I said m-a-s, t-e-r, a g with a double e,I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee,Well, my name is known all over the world,By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls,I'm goin down in history,As the baddest rapper there ever could be,Now I'm feelin' the highs and ya feelin' the lows,The beat starts gettin' into your toes,Ya start poppin' ya fingers and stompin' your feet,And movin' your body while you're sittin' in your seat,And then, damn, ya start doin' the Freak,I said damn, right outta your seat,Then ya throw your hands high in the air,Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere,Ya rockin' to the beat without a care,With the sure shot MCs for the affair,Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang,But I rap to the beat just the same,I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes,All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize,Singin' on n n on n on n on,The beat don't stop until the break of dawn,Singin' on n n on n on on n on,Like a hot buttered a pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie,Pop da pop pop, ya don't dare stop,Come alive, y'all, gimme what ya got,I guess by now, you can take a hunch,And find that I am the baby of the bunch,But that's okay I still keep in stride,'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind,Singin' on n n on n on n on,The beat don't stop until the break of dawn,Singin' on n n on n on on n on,Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor,I'm gonna freak ya here, I'm gonna feak ya there,I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere,'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind,I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind,I said 1-2-3-4, come on girls, get on the floor,A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme what ya got,'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock,I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike, what are you waitin' for?,I said-a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie,The hip hip hop-a you don't stop the rock,It to the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat,Skiddlee beebop-a we rock a scoobie doo,And guess what, America, we love you,'Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul,You could rock till you're a hundred and one years old,I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast,Rock it up, baby bubbah,Baby bubbah to the boogie, da bang bang da boogie,To the beat beat, it's so unique,Come on, everybody and dance to the beat,I said-a hip hop, the hippie the hippie,To the hip hip hop-a you dont stop,Rock it out, baby bubbah, to the boogie da bang bang,The boogie to the boogie da beat,I said I can't wait till the end of the week,When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat,And attempt to raise your body heat,Just blow your mind so that you can't speak,And do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet,And let it change up to a dance called The Freak,And when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat,Rest a little while so ya don't get weak,I know a man named Hank,He has more rhymes than a serious bank,So come on, Hank, sing that song,To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong,Well, I'm imp the dimp, the ladies pimp,The women fight for my delight,But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs,That shock the house for the young ladies,And when you come inside into the front,You do the freak, spank, and do the bump,And when the sucker MCs try to prove a point,We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint,A-from sun-to-sun and from day-to-day,I sit down and write a brand new rhyme,Because they say that miracles never cease,I've created a devastating masterpiece,I'm gonna rock the mic till you can't resist,Everybody, I say, it goes like this:,Well, I was comin' home late one dark afternoon,A reporter stopped me for a interview,She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables,That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables,This young reporter, I did adore,So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before,She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you!,The Cassanova legend must have been true!"",I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?"",Said, ""I go by the name of Lois Lane,And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman"",I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose,Flyin' through the air in pantyhose,He may be very sexy or even cute,But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit"",I said, ""You need a man who's got finesse,And his whole name across his chest,He may be able to fly all through the night,But can he rock a party till the early light?,He can't satisfy you with his little worm,But I can bust you out with my super sperm!"",I gon' do it, I gon' do it,I gon' do it, do it, do it,And I'm here, and I'm there,I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere,Just throw your hands up in the air,And party hardy like you just don't care,Let's do it, don't stop y'all,A-tick a-tock, y'all, you don't stop!,Go hotel, motel, what you gonna do today? ,I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn,You say, if your girl starts actin' up then you take her friend,I say skip, dive, what can I say?,I can't fit em all inside my OJ,So I just take half and bust them out,I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house,It was twelve o'clock one Friday night,I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right,Everybody was dancin' on the floor,Doin' all the things they never did before,And then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean,She came into the bar, she came into the scene,As she traveled deeper inside the room,All the fellas checked out her white sasoons,She came up to the table, looked into my eyes,Then she turned around and shook her behind,So I said to myself, ""It's time for me to release,My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece"",And now, people in the house, this is just for you,A little rap to make you boogaloo,Now the group ya hear is called phase two,And let me tell ya somethin', we're a helluva crew,Once a week we're on the street,Just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free,For you to party, ya got to have the moves,So we'll get right down and give you a groove,For you to dance, you gotta get hype,So we'll get right down and make you rock,Now the system's on and the girls are there,Ya definitely have a rockin affair,But let me tell ya somethin', there's still one fact:,That to have a party, ya got to have a rap,So when the party's over, you're makin' it home,And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn,And while ya sleepin', ya start to dream,And thinkin' how ya danced on the disco scene,My name appears in your mind,Yeah, a name you know that was right on time,It was phase two, just a-doin' a do,Rockin' ya down 'cause ya know we could,To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak,Come alive, girls, get on your feet,To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat,To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak,To the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on,On n on into the break of dawn,Now I got a man comin' on right now,He's guaranteed to throw down,He goes by the name of Wonder Mike,Come on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like,Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,Like a millionaire that has no money,Like a rainy day that is not wet,Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet,Like Dracula without his fangs,Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang,Like collard greens that don't taste good,Like a tree that's not made out of wood,Like goin' up and not comin' down,Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound,To the beat beat, ya do The Freak,Everybody just rock and dance to the beat,Have you ever went over a friends house to eat,And the food just ain't no good?,I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,And the chicken tastes like wood,So you try to play it off like you think you can,By sayin that you're full,And then your friend says, ""Momma, he's just being polite,He ain't finished, uh uh, that's bull!"",So your heart starts pumpin', and you think of a lie,And you say that you already ate,And your friend says, ""Man, there's plenty of food!"",So you pile some more on your plate,While the stinky foods steamin' your mind starts to dreamin',Of the moment that it's time to leave,And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin',Into something that looks like cheese,Oh so, you say, ""That's it, I got to leave this place,I don't care what these people think,I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous,With this ugly food that stinks!"",So you bust out the door while it's still closed,Still sick from the food you ate,And then you run to the store for quick relief,From a bottle of Kaopectate,And then you call your friend two weeks later,To see how he has been,And he says, ""I understand about the food, baby bubbah,But we're still friends"",With a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie,The hip hip-a hop-a you don't stop the rockin',To the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie,To the rhythm of the boogie the beat,I say, Hank, can ya rock?,Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?,Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?,I said, come on make the, make the people move,I go to the halls and then ring the bell,Because I am the man with the clientele,And if ya ask me why I rock so well,A big bang, I got clientele,And from the time I was only six years old,I never forgot what I was told,It was the best advice that I ever had,It came from my wise dear old dad,He said, ""Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you,And don't say a word until I'm through,Now, there's a time to laugh, a time to cry,A time to live and a time to die,A time to break and a time to chill,To act civilized or act real ill,But whatever ya do in your lifetime,Y'never let a MC steal your rhyme!"",So from sixty-six to this very day,I'll always remember what he had to say,So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style,I let them know that I'm versatile,I got style, finesse and a little black book,That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look,But there's a thing that separates you from me,And that is called originality,Because my rhymes are on from what you heard,I didn't even bite and not a Goddamn word,And I say a little more later on tonight,So the sucker MCs can bite all night,A-tick a-tock y'all, a-beat beat y'all,A-let's rock y'all, ya don't stop,Ya go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? ,Ya say I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spankin',Drive off in a def OJ,Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn,Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends,A-like that y'all, to the beat y'all,Beat beat ya'll, ya don't stop,A-Master Gee, am I mellow?,It's on you, so whatcha gonna do?,Well, like Johnny Carson on The Late Show,A-like Frankie Crocker in stereo,Well, like The Bar-Kay's singin' Holy Ghost,The sounds to throw down, they're played the most,It's like my man, Captain Sky,Whose name he earned with his super sperm,We rock and we don't stop,Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got,To the beat that it makes you freak,And come alive, girl, get on your feet,A-like a Perry Mason without a case,Like Farrah Fawcett without her face,Like The Bar-Kays on the mic,Like gettin' right down for you tonight,Like movin' your body so ya don't know how,Right to the rhythm and throw down,Like comin' alive to the Master Gee,The brother who rocks so viciously,I said, the age of one, my life begun,At the age of two, I was doin the' do,At the age of three, it was you and me,Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee,At the age of four, I was on the floor,Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for,At the age of five, I didn't take no jive,With the Master Gee, it's all the way live,At the age of six, I was a-pickin' up sticks,Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed,At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven,Dontcha know I went off?,I got right on down to the beat, you see,Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls,Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat,To the double beat beat that makes you freak,At the age of eight, I was really great,'Cause every night, you see I had a date,At the age of nine, I was right on time,'Cause every night, I had a party rhyme,Goin' on n n on n on on n on,The beat don't stop until the break of dawn,A-sayin' on n n on n on on n on...,Like a hot buttered de pop de pop de pop,A-saying on n n on n on on n on,I say you don't stop, gimme what ya got,'Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic,I am the definite feast delight,'Cause I'm a helluva man when i'm on the miC,I am the definite feast delight,Come to the Master Gee, you see,The brother who rocks so viciously
