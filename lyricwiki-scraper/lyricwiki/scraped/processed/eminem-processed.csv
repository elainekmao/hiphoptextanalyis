2001,Eminem,"I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless,Patrolling corners,Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters,I'm meaner in action,Than Rosco beating James Tarteenyer,And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments,I grew up in the wild hood,As a hazardous youth,With a fucked up childhood,That I used as an excuse,And aint shit changed,But kept the same mindstate,Since the third time that I failed 9th grade,You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it,I don't promote violence I just encourage it,I laugh at the sight of death,As I fall down a cement flight of steps,And land inside a bed of spider webs,So throw caution to the wind,You and a friend,Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again,Shit, why not?  Blow your brain out,I'm blowing mine out,Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now,It's only fair to warn,I was born with a set of horns,And metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord,Warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board,That smashed into your Honda Accord,With a 4 door Ford,But a more toward  droppin an accapella,The choppa  fella,The mozarella,Worse than a hellacopta propella,Got you locked in the cella,With your skeleton showing,Developing anorexia,While I'm standin next to ya,Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death,With an IV in your veins,Feeding you liquid darvicet,Pumping you full of drugs,Pull the plugs,On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs,Who were picked up in an ambulance,And driven,To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants,And given,A less than 20 percent chance,Of living,Have a possible placement,It's a hospital patient,Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement,Doctor Kevorkian has arrived,To perform an autopsy on you while you scream ""I'M STILL ALIVE!"",Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp,And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth,Better call the fire department,I've hired a arson,To set fire to carpet,And burn up your entire apartment,I'm a liar to start shit ,Got your bitch wrapped around my dick,So tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit,Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg,Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg,Go to bed with the keg wake up with the 40,Mixed up with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D,Fuck an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead,Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead,No more said case closed end of discussion,I'm blowin up like spontaneous human combustion,Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas,Cross the bombas,We blowin up your house killing your parents,and coming back to get your foster mommas,And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus,Cause I aint making no more threats,I'm doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets,I'm more or less sick in the head,Maybe more cause I smoked crack,today, yesterday, and the day before sabbath,Walk the block with a labrador,Strapit more corral for war than El Salvador,Foul style galore,Verbal cow manure,Coming together like the eyebrow on Al B.

Fuck your litte bitch ass up,We are not killers, my vato will have you shot though,Drag through the body on fuck, like Kim Osario's,Litte sorry hoe ass, go ask B Real,We burn source covers like fuckin Cypress Hill,Did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still,Shady records you better believe the hype is real,This is no joke, I don't smoke,But I toke enough second hand to make my fuckin B.O. choke,I'm an OG, you're fuckin with a GI Joe,Bia Bia, mia meo a vida loco,I'm a psycho, Mariah aint got shit on me,When I retire I'll be spittin baby food on people,A tent siege on ranch, huddled up next to her,With Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs,You ever had your cap pealed back or your shit pushed in,I put my blade in you like a fucking pin cushion,Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Henn dogg,I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dogg,Nobody told you that I'm loco essay?,I lack every sane chemical in my membrane,I'm slim sha...dy and the \""d\"" is for deez nuts,And you can get each one for free so feast up,I pee in a cup for three months, I'm having an E party for easter,Please come,Sweet done,,We gonna bring it to anybody who want it,You want it? you gonna get it,Your name on it we'll hit em, chew em up and spit em out,Too much venom and if you role with 'em,We gonna fuck you up with 'em,You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest,I got a 12 gauge mossberg to pump up your chest,Have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest,Fear me like you fear god cause I bring death,Silver Back guerrilla in the concrete jungle,I'm the strongest around you know how I get down,I watch gansta flicks and root for the badguy,And turn it off before it ends cause the badguy die,If you trying to buy guns I'm the nigga to look to,So what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new,You can raise your voice like you fending to touch something,When I raise my knife shit I'm fending to cut something,See I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie,If the bitch think I love her the bitch don't know me,,Chorus,,Souls Assasins y'all,What up Muggs?,,What up Em?,,We outta here...,

Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!,On, Comet! On Cupid! On, Donder and Blitzen!,To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!,Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"",And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof,The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.,As I drew in my hand, and was turning around,,Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.,He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,,And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;,A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,,And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.,His eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!,His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!,His cute little mouth was just like a bow,,And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;,He had a broad face and a little round belly,,That shook, like a bowlful of jelly.,He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,,And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;,A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,,Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;,He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,,And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,,And laying his finger aside of his nose,,And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;,He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,,And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.,But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,,""Merry Christmas to all, and good-night.""

NO DATE Eminem:The Apple,Eminem,"I'm a little nutty and i know it,But if you go back and take a look at my history,You will see that i'm not the only one who's off his rocker,There were many before me,I was always labelled the black sheep of the family,What a bad seed i grow to be,But if you take a look at us now,You'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree,,Alright, look,I'ma tell you the story from my side,Maybe you'll understand,Check it out,You done witnessed unexplainable shit,Too insane to explain,People run from what the just don't get,Maybe shady shoulda just hit 'em with a little bit,Did i spit too soon? should i of spoon fed 'em it?,But i was just so eager to prove i was even worth,Being in the same league or the room with,Of the people of whom i was in,Every now and then i look up like i was seeking approval,Was it because of the pigment of my skin,Or was it a figment of my imagination,Maybe it bothered me more than it did them,Maybe it wasn't a big deal back then,But to me it was, see what it was was,I had developed the complex from being judged,Proof spit his verse, now i'm next, let's see who ,I'm in the booth staring back to see who's mugs,I get a reaction from, usually the first thumb was from proof,And the rest of the group backed him up,And no one lied to each other cause none of us had deals,It was real, we just wanted tickets for that meal,Sometimes i feel like it's just me,Sometimes i feel like i'm going crazy,But take a look at my family,Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree,I said...,Sometimes i feel like it's just me,Sometimes i feel like i'm going crazy,But take a look at my family,Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree,Ever since my mother was pregnant,With her second egg cause she said,That i had a baby sister who fell out of the window,I was too young to remember,Kansas city projects,I was like 5, 6, and how come,I remember malcolm, isaac, and boogie,If it was the projects in missouri?,Cause those're my best friends until isaac,Took my tricycle and my uncle todd went to try to go get it back,And ended up getting jumped and cut in the gut with a switch and 70-some stitches,Which is still, to this day,Why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture,Of a fictitious little sister who never existed,And this is why part of my life's so twisted,But i can never be as sick as that bitch is,And, by the way, that picture's one of my relatives,Sometimes i feel like it's just me,Sometimes i feel like i'm going crazy,But take a look at my family,Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree,I said...,Sometimes i feel like it's just me,Sometimes i feel like i'm going crazy,But take a look at my family,Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree,You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain,To see why everything i say is so insane,What's different about my brain,That separates me from other players in this game?,On the surface, it may seem like a scheme,Or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy,But that's the last thing i need is for people,To walk around feeling sorry for me ,And i'm not a g, never claimed to be,I gave my vest to cashis, just hope he,Dont need it more than me,But we'll see, cause we ain't lookin' for beef,But if it comes our way, what do we, turn the other cheek?,Come on,Sometimes i feel like it's just me,Sometimes i feel like i'm going crazy,But take a look at my family,Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree,I said...,Sometimes i feel like it's just me,Sometimes i feel like i'm going crazy,But take a look at my family,Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

I ain't apologizin' for shit.,I'm a G.O.A.T.,And I don't mean to gloat, but I know what I know and I know what you think,And these magazines'll never put it in ink,Because how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?,And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is, it means the ""Greatest Of All-Time"", and I consider myself one of those, so thank you very much here it goes,Man, I'm takin' my ball and going home, man,This shit is too easy,Nobody even wants to pass me the ball, 'cause ,So don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game,And y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best, but y'all know that ,And like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch,,Before I go I'd like to say fuck you very much to everyone who wasn't there from the start,And thank you very much to everbody who was,,And you don't gotta say it, just think it,'Cause I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that ,Hahahaha,I'm out y'all, it's been real,,Peace

NO DATE Eminem:Eminem Part 1,Eminem,"Met a retarded kid named greg, with a wooden leg,Snatched it off and beat him over the head with the peg,Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a forty,Mix it with alka seltzer and formula 44-d,Forget an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead,Wait until it absorbed and fell to the floor dead,No more said case closed end of discussion,We blowing up like spontaneous human combustion,Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and dramas,Cross the bombest,We blowing up your house,Killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas,I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus's,Cause I ain't making no more threats,I'm doing drive-bys in tinted corvettes,On Vietnam war vets,I am more or less sick in the head,Maybe more,Because I smoked crack today, yesterday,,And the day before sabateur,Walk the block with a Labrador,Strapped with more straps than el salvador,Foul style galore,Verbal cow manure,Coming together like an eyebrow on al b. sure

NO DATE Eminem:8 Mile Road,Eminem,"It's okay, it's okay,I'm gonna make it anyway,,Sometimes I just feel like, quitting I still might,Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write,Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' wit real life,Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics,And show these people what my level of skills like,But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life,Something ain't right, hit the brake lights,Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like,Uh, da di da , it ain't my fault,Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl,And I clam up, I just slam shut,I just can't do it, my whole manhood's,Just been stripped, I have just been ripped,So I must then get, off this bus then split,Man fuck this shit yo, I'm going the fuck home,World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 mile road,I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan,Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land,Time for me to just take matters into my own hands,Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back,8 mile road, and I'm gone, I know right where I'm going,Sorry mama I'm grown, I must travel alone,Ain't following no footsteps, I'm making my own,Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 mile road,I'm walking these train tracks, tryin' to regain back,The spirit I had fore I go back to the same crap,To the same plant, in the same pants,Tryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAP,And get a new plan, momma's got a new man,Poor little baby sister, she don't understand,Sits in front of the T.V, buries her nose in the pad,And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand,While she colors her big brother, her mother and dad,Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head,Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had,But I keep runnin' from something I never wanted so bad!,Sometimes I get upset, 'cause I ain't blew up yet,It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet,Don't got a rep my step, don't got enough pep,The pressures too much man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best,And I try, sit alone and I cry,Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by,That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin' You, God,Please don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job,Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are,Yo I'm tellin' you dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow,Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye,Say whenever you need me baby I'm never to far,But yo I gotta get out there the only way that I know,And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow,On everything I own, I'll make it on my own,Off to work I go, back to this 8 mile road,I'm a man, gotta make a new plan,Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land,Time for me to just take matters into my own hands,Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back,8 mile road, and I'm gone, I know right where I'm going,Sorry mama I'm grown, I must travel alone,Ain't following no footsteps, I'm making my own,Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 mile road,You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it,Or see what the big deal is, why it wasn't it still is,To be walkin' this boarder line of Detroit city limits,It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate,Of authenticity, you've never even seen,But it's everthing to me, it's my credibility,You've never seen, heard, smelled, or met a real MC,Who's incredible on the same pedestal as me,But yet still unsigned, having a rough time,Sit on the porch wit all my friends and kick dumb rhymes,Go to work and serve MC's in the lunch line,But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?,Who must I show to bust my flow?,Where must I go, who must I know?,Or am I just another crab in the bucket,'Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it,Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit,I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with,I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit,At the salvation army tryin' to salvage an outfit,And it's cold tryin' to travel this road,Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode,My defenses are so up, and one thing I don't want,Is pity from no one, this city is no fun,There is no sun, and it's so dark,Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart,From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends,It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin,Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not,What I'm doin' I just blow, my head is a stove top,I just explode, the kettle gets so hot,Sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't got,But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn,Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned,Ain't no falling no next time I meet a new girl,I can no longer play stupid or be immature,I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage,Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words,Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge,Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred,Time to show these free world leaders I'm three in the third,I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird,Then I turn and cross over the median curb,Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 mile road,I'm a man, gotta make a new plan,Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land,Time for me to just take matters into my own hands,Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back,8 mile road, and I'm gone, I know right where I'm going,Sorry mama I'm grown, I must travel alone,Ain't following no footsteps, I'm making my own,Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 mile road

It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve ,Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats,Why we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he fucked us both,We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close ,Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings,Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road,And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load,Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and,That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changable,And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but,I guess we are who we are,Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on,Maybe we took this too far,Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though,Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth,But I'm sorry mama for Cleaning Out My Closet, at the time I was angry,Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, cause,Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes,That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio,And I think of Nathan being placed in a home,And all the medicine you fed us,And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but,Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow,And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though,But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo,All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both,Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours,But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, cause,One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was,Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address,But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus,Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas,Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's,If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them,And although one has met their grandma,Once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some handburgers,Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you,And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me,As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and,I saw your headlights as I looked back,And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad,So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet,I guess I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead,The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing,So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you this message that I'll always love you from afar,Cause you're my mama...,I guess we are who we are,Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on,Maybe we took this too far,I want a new life,One without a cause,So I'm coming home tonight,Well no matter what the cost,And if the plane goes down,And if the crew can't wake me up,Just know that I was alright,And I was not afraid to die,Even if there's songs to sing,My children will carry me,Just know that I'm alright,I was not afraid to die,Because I put my faith in my new girl,So I never say goodbye cruel world,Just know that I'm alright,I am not afraid to die,I guess we are who we are,Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on,Maybe we took this too far,I want a new life.

I'm just a fucking romantic,I fucking love you, you fucking bitch!,Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex,I actually set off a chain reaction, a tragic event,I said ""hit the road"" and after she left,I sent that bitch a text,I said ""be careful driving, don't read this and have a accident"",She glanced to look at it and write, too bad,Thought we had a connect,No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case,Than a model covered in L'Oreal and mace, who fell from grace,Eleven stories for story telling but the whore was yelling ""rape"",So the vocal cords were swelling and her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spelling's face,Still they swarm the gates and my fans making stakes to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace,Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date, don't be late,Well the sentiments great, but wait then there's been a mistake,You want an intimate date, I wanna intimidate,I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly because of the game of--, Wait, dinner at eight,I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly because of the,Game of love, love, love, love,La-la, la-la-la-love

induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n',Roll Hall of Fame,Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames,Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame,On the wall of shame,You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames,Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?,Little gay looking boy,So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy,You witnessing a massacre,Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy,Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy,You get a thumbs up, pat on the back,And a way

you be Thor and I'll be Odin,Rodent, I'm omnipotent,Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin',And I should not be woken,I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating,But I got your mom deep throating,I'm out my Ramen noodle,We have nothing in common, poodle,I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil,It's me, my honesty's brutal,But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though,For good at least once in a while,So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle,Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times,But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned,Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime,I know there was a time where once I,Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind,So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine,Appeal with the skin color of mine,You get too big and here they come trying to censor you,Like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from the Marshall Mathers LP,One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine,Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine,See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal,You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though,And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for,You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows,You're like normal, fuck being normal,And I just bought a new Raygun from the future,To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad,Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad,Singin' to a man while they played piano,Oh, man, oh, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel,So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day,Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, ,Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human,What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman,Innovative and I'm made of rubber,So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you,I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating,How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating,Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting,For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating,Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated,I make elevating music, you make elevator music,Oh, he's too mainstream,Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it,It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it,With rock, shock rap with Doc,Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it,I don't know how to make songs like that,I don't know what words to use,Let me know when it occurs to you,While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you,It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you,How many verses I gotta murder to prove,That if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too,School flunky, pill junky,But look at the accolades the skills brung me,Full of myself, but still hungry,I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to,And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues,But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you,I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat,Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky,But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling,Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me,They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate,But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had,Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation,And understand the discrimination,But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then,But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?,Don't mistake it for Satan,It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas,And take a vacation to trip a broad,And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard,Be a king? Think not - why be a king when you can be a God?

Don’t got, I don’t care, don’t have two shits to give,Let me take you by the hand, to promise land, and threaten everyone,Cause there’s no rhyme or no reason for nothing, Shady, I don’t give a fuck, but I wonder, Doubt it, ha,,So yeah dad let's walk,Let's have us a father and son talk,But I bet we probably wouldn't get one block,Without me knocking your block off,This is all your fault,Maybe that's why I'm always so bananas,I appeal to all those walks of like,Whoever had strife,Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like,Cause I related to the struggles of Young America,When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles,Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again,It's a stare ruckle, I chuckle,Cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles,Yeah, uh oh, better beware knuckleheads,The sound of my hustle says don't knock,The doors broken it won't lock,It might just fly open, get cold cocked,You critics come pay to me a visit,Misery loves company, please stay a minute,Kryptonite to a hypocrite,Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it,Too busy getting stoned in your glass house,To kick rocks, and you wonder why I lash out,Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers,Spread the word cause I'm promoting my passion till I'm passed out,A completely brain dead Rainman,Doing a bankhead in a restraint chair,So bitch, if you shoot me a look it better be a blank stare,Or get shanked in the pancreas, I'm angrier than,All 8 of the reindeer put together with Chief Keef,Cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah,Even this rhyme bitch, and quit tryna look,For a fucking reason for it that ain't there,But I still am a criminal,Ten year old degenerate grabbing on my genitals,The last Mathers LP that went diamond,This time I'm predicting this one will go emerald,When will the madness end, how can it when,There's no method the pad and pen,The only message that I have to say is:,Dad, I'm back at it again,Bitch

2013,Eminem,"It’s like I'm in the dirt, digging up old hurt,Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won’t work,All it takes is one song on the radio you’re right back on it,Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off,And left me so burned, spent a lot of time trying to soul search,Maybe I needed to grow up a little first,Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt,But I am coming for closure,Don’t suppose an explanation I’m owed for,The way that you turned your back on me,Just when I may have needed you most,Oh, you thought it was over,You can just close the chapter,And go about your life, like it was nothing,You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine,I’d never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha,'bout to go through’s tougher than anything I ever have suffered,Can’t think of a better way to define poetic justice,Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: ""let it go, fuck this"",Heart is saying: ""I will once I bury this bitch alive,Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"",I flee the scene like it was my last ride,You see right through,Oh, you had me pegged the first time,You can't see the truth,But it's easier to justify,What's bad is good,And I hate to be the bad guy,I just hate to be the bad guy,And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch,To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit,Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?,Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch,Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit,Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!,You left our family in shambles,You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed,Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten,And don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long,That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya,You're wrong and that shit was rotten,And the way you played him, same shit you did to me,Have you any idea that shit I've gone through?,Feelings I harbor, all this pain of resentment I hold on to,Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing,Letters, you don't respond to 'em,Fuck it, I'm coming to see you,And gee who better to talk to than you?,The cause to my problems,My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you,Poof, then I'm gone,I flee the scene like it was my last ride,You see right through,Oh, you had me pegged the first time,You can't see the truth,But it's easier to justify,What's bad is good,And I hate to be the bad guy,I just hate to be the bad guy,I've been driving around your side of the town,Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now,Finally I found your new address, park in your drive,Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life,And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva,My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house,See, it's sad it came to this point,Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya,But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology,Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek,So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window,Like I reach my full potential, I peeked,Continue to peep, still bent low,Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo,Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch,Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this,You don't plan for intruders before hand?,Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?,Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost half of a lung,Like you picked up an axe up and then swung,Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk,By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?,Now who's a faggot, you punk?,And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back as they suck,It's just me, you and the music now, Slim,I hope you hear it we are in a car right now,Wait, here comes my favorite lyric,I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die,And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP,Just to try to get people to buy,How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun,Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done,Eminem killed by Eminem,Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials,I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it,Since you love your city so much,I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here,Two more exits, town is quite near,I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear,That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea,As cops appear in my driver side mirror,,Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial,New plan Stan,Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car,Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you,Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, hope you can swim good!,Now say you hate homos again!,I also represent anyone normally seen on the end of these jokes of a beat,I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in,I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen,Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin,No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in,When they say all of this is approaching its end,But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again,Backs to the wall, I’m stacking up all them odds, toilets clogged,Yeah ‘cause I’m talking a lot of shit but I’m backing it all up,But in my head there’s a voice in the back and it hollas,After the track is demolished,I am your lack of a conscience,I’m the ringing in your ears,I’m the polyps on the back of your tonsils,Eating your vocal chords after your concerts,I’m your time that’s almost up that you haven’t acknowledged,Grab for some water but I’m that pill that’s too jagged to swallow,I’m the bullies you hate that you became,With every faggot you slaughtered,Coming back on you every woman you insult there,With the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters,I represent everything you take for granted,‘Cause Marshall Mather’s the rapper’s persona’s have a facade and ,Matthew and Stan’s just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until it’s gone,‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name,Cameras are off, sad when it happens to all of them?,I am hindsight to say, “I told you so!”,Foreshadows of all, things that are to follow,I'm the future, the TV show you will heard this tomorrow,If you don’t stop after they call you,The biggest laughing stock of rap who can’t call it quits,But it’s time to walk away,I’m every guilt trip the baggage you had,But as you gather up all your possessions,If there's anything you have left to say,Unless it makes an impact don't bother,So before you rest your case,Better make sure you're packing a wallop,So one last time, I’m back,Before it fades into black and it’s all over,Behold the final chapter in the saga,Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle,Twice the magic that started it all,Tragic portrait of an artist tortured,Trapped in his own drawings,Tap into thoughts,Blacker and darker than anything imaginable,Here goes a wild stab in the dark,As we pick up the last Mathers’ last art

2013,Eminem,"Yeah, trying to figure out the difference,But I think.. I think the lines are starting to get blurry,I'm in a strange place,I feel like Mase when he gave up the game for his faith,I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints,Grinning every stranger in the place while I gaze into space,Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face,I need a change of pace cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous,There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst,I done quit chicken heads in cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em,Cause that's where most of my anger is based,Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints,I just want to hurt you, aim for the skanks,Then aim for all these fake Kanye's, Jay's, Wayne's and the Drake's,I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of wack,I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack,I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is,I'm strapped for battles, suck a duck, crawl out the back, bar fight,Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air,And bottles breaking, mirrors also,And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full,You done called every woman a slut, but you forgetting Sarah, Marshall,Oh my bad, slut,And next time I show up in court I'll be naked and square a lawsuit,Judge be like ""That's sharp, how much that motherfucker cost you?,Smart ass, you lucky I don't tear it off you,And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker,You so fucking gravy, Marshall, I should start calling you au jus,Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo,Evil twin, take this beat now, it's on you"",I believe people can change, but only for the worse,I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse,So satanic Kmart chains panic,Cause they can't even spin back the curse words,Cause it works when they're reversed, motherfucker,And these kids are like parrots,They run around the house just like terrorists,Screaming ""fuck, shit, fuck"",Adult with a child is like arrogance,Wild ever since the day I came out I was like ""merits, fuck that"",I'd rather be loud and I like swearing,From the first album even the gals were like ""tight lyrics, dreamy eyes"",But my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish,And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this,And the opposition felt the opposite,Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums,Often as I can and skim through all them bitches,To make sure I keep up with my competition,Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes,Borderline genius who's bored of his lines,And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now,Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies,This darkness comes in me,,And comes again,,That ain't me, he's my evil twin,,He's just a friend who pops up now and again,So don't blame me, blame him,My evil twin,,So who's left?

Relax"",And since I'm, convinced that I'm an insomniac,I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps,Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see,That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium, three?,And that will average out to about one good hour's, sleep,Ok so now ya, see, the reason how come, he,Has taken four years to just put out an album, B,See me and you we almost had the same outcome, Heath,'Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia, thing,It was bologna was it the methadone, ya think,Or the hydrocordone, you hide inside your pornos,Your VCR tape cases, with you Amb!en CR, great paces to hide 'em ain't it,So you can lie to Hailie,,""I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Alaina"",Go in the room and shut the bedroom door,And wake up in an ambulance,They said they found me on the bathroom floor,Damn,Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know,Feels like I been down this road before,So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me,As soon as I go home and close the door,Kinda feels like déjà vu,I wanna get away from this place I do,But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know,That's a lie, 'cause I don't and why I just don't know

2004,Eminem,"Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now.,But hey, what daddy always tell you?,Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip.,What you crying about?,You got me.,Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad,When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had,I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh,I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry,'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers,No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares,We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it,Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it,We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls,When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls,Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you,Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news,I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems,The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me,All the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see,Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did,We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me,But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together,Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers,But then of course everything always happens for a reason,I guess it was never meant to be ,But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is,But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep,Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream,Now hush little baby, don't you cry,Everything's gonna be alright,Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya,Daddy's here to hold ya through the night,I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why,We fear how we feel inside,It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby,But I promise mama's gon' be alright,It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money,Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree ,And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em,I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying,'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job,But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom,And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed,Or shot up on the block and your mom,Was saving money for you in a jar,Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college,Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it,And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart,And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart,Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back,On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment,And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara,And that's when daddy went to California with his CD,And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me,But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me,Then you started seeing daddy on the TV ,And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it,Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit,And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it,I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand,'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud,Now I'm sittin' in this empty house,Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out,To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now,Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here,Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here,I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?,Shh, mama's only gone for the moment,Now hush little baby, don't you cry,Everything's gonna be alright,Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya,Daddy's here to hold ya through the night,I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why,We fear how we feel inside,It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby,But I promise mama's gon' be alright,And if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird,I'mma give you the world,I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you,I'll do anything for you to see you smile,And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine,I'mma break that birdies' neck,I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya,And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad ,

2004,Eminem,"What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough,If you will, to be saved not in a religious sense, ,but not to constitute what this country, at times, calls ""we throw away children"",We seem to be approaching an age of the gross ,We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents station,And each generation should do a little bit better,Alright come on let's cut this bullshittin' and dub,Let's get it started let's start addressin' this issue,And open it up,Let's take this shit back to the basement,And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape,And this whole origin of,The music that we all know and love the music we all enjoy,The music that you accuse me of tryin' to destroy,Let's rewind it to '89 when I was boy on the East side of Detroit,Crossin' 8 Mile and a war and they hit territory,I'd like to share a story this is my story,And can't nobody tell it for me,I am well aware that I don't belong here,You made that perfectly clear,I get my ass kicked, damn they're everywhere,From Bel Air shoppin' centre just for stoppin' in there,From the black side all the way to the white side,Okay there's a bright side,A day that I might slide,You may call it a pass I call it haulin' my ass,Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks,Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks,Them good old notorious, so well known tracks,So let's go back,Follow the yellow brick road,As we go on another episode,Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place,That I once used to call home sweet home,Come on, let's go back,Follow the yellow brick road,As we go on another episode,Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place,That I once used to call home sweet home,I roam the streets so much they call me a drifter,Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitchhike,Just to get picked up they'd give me a lift up,8 Mile and Van Dyke I'd steal a goddamn bike,From somebody's backyard,And drop it off at the park,That was the halfway mark,To meet Kim had to walk back to her momma's and charmer's,After dark to sneak me in the house,When I'm kicked out my mom's,That's about the time I first met Proof, we'd goof,He'd carry on the steps said I was bored handin' out some flyers,He was doin' some talent shows at Center Line High,I told him to stop by and check this out some time,He looked at me like I'm out my mind,Shook his head like white boys don't know how to rhyme,I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place,And they both had the same rhymes that soundalike,We was on that same shit, that , shit,Where compound syllables sound combined,From that day we was down to ride,Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line,So let's go back,Follow the yellow brick road,As we go on another episode,Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place,That I once used to call home sweet home,Come on, let's go back,Follow the yellow brick road,As we go on another episode,Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place,That I once used to call home sweet home,My first year in 9th grade ,Can't forget that day in school ,It was cool til' your man MC Sham came through,And said that Puma's the brand 'cause the Klan makes Troops,It was rumors but man, goddamn they flew,Must'a been true because man we done banned they shoes,,I had the new ones, the cool J, Ice-lambs, suede too.,But we just threw 'em in the trash like they was yesterday's news,Guess who came through next? X-clan debuted,With a key sissies now with this being a new trend,We don't fit in crackers is out with Cactus albums,Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions,Represents black power and we ain't know what it meant,Me and my man Howard and Butter, would go to the mall with 'em,All over our necks like we're showing 'em off,Not knowing at all we was being laughed at you ain't even half black,You ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that,And that Flavor Flave clock we gonna have to snatch that,All I remember is meeting back at,Manix's basement, saying how we hate this, how racist but dope the x clan's tape is...,Which reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time,She was tryna two time me,And there was this black girl,At our school who thought I was cool cause I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me,And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gonna say it plus,The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs,The bombest goddamn girl in our whole school if I could pull it,Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time,But it backfired I was supposed to dump her,But she dumped me for this black guy,And thats the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to,The oh foolish pride girl,But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad,But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize, I was wrong,'Cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a hoe,So let's go back,Follow the yellow brick road,As we go on another episode,Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place,That I once used to call home sweet home,Come on, let's go back,Follow the yellow brick road,As we go on another episode,Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place,That I once used to call home sweet home

2004,Eminem,"Father please forgive me for I know not what I do,I just never had the chance to ever meet you,Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be,My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds,Mama had a baby and it's head popped off, head popped off,Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off,My mama don't want me, the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off,Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off,Ring ring ring, on the door bell and the next door neighbor,

2002,"Eminem,Steven Tyler","These ideas are nightmares to white parents,Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings,Like whatever they say has no bearing,It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing,To see him walking around with his headphones blaring,Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care,He's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out,When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out,'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out,But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out,His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back,Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap,He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap,His stepfather hit him so he socked him back,And broke his nose, his house is a broken home,There's no control, he just lets his emotions go, Sing with me, , for the year ,For the laughter, sing for the tear ,Sing it with me, if it's just for today,Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away,Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangstas,In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum,Holy or unholy, only have one homie,Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me,Yet everybody just feels like they can relate,I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great,Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate,It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make,Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum,Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen,From standin' on corners and porches just rappin',To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass,But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you,Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you,To get they hands on every dime you have,They want you to lose your mind every time you mad,So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon,Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns,That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me,Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly,But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously,So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me,They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me,If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense B,It's all political, if my music is literal,And I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl,I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to,You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you, Sing with me,  for the year ,For the laughter, sing for the tears ,Sing it with me, if it's just for today,Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away,They say music can alter moods and talk to you,Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too,Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude,Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued,See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols,And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool,Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers,Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus,But music is reflection of self, we just explain it,And then we get our checks in the mail, it's fucked up ain't it,How we can come from practically nothing,To being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted,That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing,Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine,Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long,Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs,Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives,Till they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die,Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe,We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes,That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it,Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden,And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on,Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can,Sing with me, , for the year ,For the laughter, sing for the tears ,Sing it with me, if it's just for today,Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away,Sing with me, , for the year ,For the laughter, sing for the tears ,Sing it with me, if it's just for today,Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

As soon as I pull it you sweat bullets ,An excellent method to get rid of the next bully,It's actually better, 'cause instead of you murdering,You can hurt 'em then come back again and kick dirt in them,It's like pouring salt in your wounds, assault and get sued,You can smell the lawsuits as soon as I waltz in the room,Everybody's hearts just stop, they call the cops,All you see is bitches coming out their halter tops,Running and ducking at the Hot Rock's parking lot,You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not,'Cause I'm a soldier,These shoulders hold up so much,They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up,I'm a soldier,Even if my collar bones crush or crumble,I will never slip or stumble,I'm a soldier,These shoulders hold up so much,They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up,I'm a soldier,Even if my collar bones crush or crumble,I will never slip or stumble,I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talking to 'em,Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em,I'm like a thug, with a little bit of 'Pac influence,I spew it and look how I got you bitches rocking to it,You motherfuckers could never do it like I can do it,Don't even try, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it,Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest,I spill the illest shit ever could drive me to it,So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock,Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on the cock,Listen to the sound of me spilling my heart through this pen,Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again,Full of controversy until I retire my jersey,'Til the fire inside dies and expires at 30,And Lord have mercy on anymore of these rappers that verse me,And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity,I'm a soldier,These shoulders hold up so much,They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up,I'm a soldier,Even if my collar bones crush or crumble,I will never slip or stumble,I'm a soldier,These shoulders hold up so much,They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up,I'm a soldier,Even if my collar bones crush or crumble,I will never slip or stumble,Yo left, yo left, yo left right left,Yo left, yo left, yo left right left,Yo left, yo left, yo left right left,Yo left, yo left, yo left right left

him all the time , ,So kids say no to drugs ,So you don't act like everyone else does ,And there's really nothing else to say ,Drugs are just bad, m'kay,My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it,Fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut ,Speaking of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels,Ecstasy, it's the worst drug in the world,If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it,Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid,And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back,So don't get attached it'll attack every bone in your back,Meet Zach, 21 years old,After hanging out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold,And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys,And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it,Suddenly, he starts to convulse, and his pulse,Goes into hyperdrive, and his eyes roll back in his skull,His back arches up, looks like the McDonalds arches,He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin',And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him ,""Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him."" ,'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny ,So they're laughing at basically nothing, except maybe wasting their money,Meanwhile Zach's in a coma, the action is over,And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicing yoga ,And that's the story of Zach: the ecstasy maniac,So don't even feed that to squirrels class, 'cause it's bad for you ,:,See children, drugs are bad ,And if you don't believe me ask your dad ,And if you don't believe him ask your mom ,She'll tell you how she does him all the time , ,So kids say no to drugs ,So you don't act like everyone else does ,And there's really nothing else to say ,Drugs are just bad, m'kay,And last but not least, one of the most humongous,Problems among young people today, is fungus,It grows from cow manure, they pick it out wipe if off bag it up,And you put it right in your mouth and chew it ,And then you start to see some dumb stuff,And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em,And sometimes you see things that aren't there ,Like fat women in g-strings with orange hair,""Mr. Shady, what's a g-string?"", it's yarn Clair,Women stick them up their behinds, go out and wear 'em,And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms,Whoops did I say magic mushrooms, I meant fungus,Your tongue gets, all swole up like a cow's tongue ,'Cause it comes from a cow's dung,See drugs are bad, it's a common fact,But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at,But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and go and OD,They're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee,And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault,So don't drugs and do exactly as I don't, because I'm bad for you,:,See children, drugs are bad ,And if you don't believe me ask your dad ,And if you don't believe him ask your mom ,She'll tell you how she does him all the time , ,So kids say no to drugs ,So you don't act like everyone else does ,And there's really nothing else to say ,Drugs are just bad, m'kay,:,Come on children, clap along ,Sing along children ,Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad ,So don't do drugs ,So there'll be more for me (,Mushrooms killed Kenny!....Ewww, ahhh!,So, fucked up, right now.,

Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan,I just don't want you to do some crazy s**t,I seen this one s**t on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick,Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge,And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid,And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to,Come to think about, his name was... it was you,Damn!

NO DATE Eminem:Greg,Eminem,"Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg,Snatched it off, and beat him over the fuckin' head with the peg,Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a forty,Mixed it with Alka-Seltzer and Formula 44-D,Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead,Waited until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead,No more said, case closed, end of discussion,I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion,Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas,Cross the bombest?!,We blowin' up your house, killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas,And I'm as good at keepin' a promise as Nostradamus,Cause I ain't making no more threats,I'm doing drive-bys in tinted corvettes on Vietnam war vets,I'm more or less sick in the head,Maybe more, 'cause I smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before,Sabateur; walk the block with a labrador,Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador,Foul-style galore, verbal cow manure,Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al B.

1999,Eminem,"I dont know why this world keeps turning,Round and Round,But I wish it would stop, and let me off right now,Yes man,As the World Turns,We all experience things in life,Trials and Tribulations,That we all must go through,When someone wants to test us,When someone tries our patience,I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters,Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns,Outsiders baby and we suing the courts,Cuz we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source,They never should've booted me out of reform school,Deformed fool, takin a shit in a warm pool,So they threw me out the Ramada Inn,I said it wasn't me, I got a twin ,It all started when my mother took my bike away,'Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave,After that, It was straight to the 40 ouncers,Slappin teachers and jackin off in front of my counselors,Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman,Fuck the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin',And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead,He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed,Maybe true, till I told this bitch in gym class,That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim Fast ,Yeah bitch, you so big you walked into big Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig,She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig,Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig,I felt the evilness and started transformin, ,It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming,Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground,And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down,Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop,While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop,As the World Turns,These are the days of our lives,These are the things that we must go through,Day by day,We drive around in million dollar sports cars,While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards,Outsiders and we suing the courts,Cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source,Hypercondriac, hanging out at the laundry-mat,Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at,Dressed like a sailor, standin by a pale of garbage,Its almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch,I met a slut and said ""What up, its nice to meet ya"",I'd like to treat ya to a faygo and a slice of pizza,But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month,But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt,But I aint got no weed, no phillies, or no papers,Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist,So gimme all your money and don't try nothin funny,'Cause you know your stinkin ass is too fat to try to out run me,I went to grab my gun,Thats when her ass put it on me,Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry,I fell through the glass doors, started causin a scene,Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin machine,Jumped up with a broken back,Thank god I was smokin crack all day and doped up off coke and smack,All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse,Now I wanna kill her, but so I gotta catch her first,Ran through alleys, parkin lots and took a shortcut,Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin porch up,Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut,Looked around the room, that's when I seen the bedroom door shut,I know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked!,You might as well come out now,She said ""Come in, its unlocked!"",I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne,And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn,She said ""Come here big boy, lets get acquainted"",I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it,She came at me at full speed, nothin could stop her,I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her,I started to beg ""No, please let go"",But she swallowed my fuckin leg whole like an egg roll,With one leg left, now I'm hoppin around crippled,I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple,Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick,Den Den Den Den Den Den, Go go gadget dick!,Whipped that shit out, and aint no doubt about it,It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage,I shouted ""Now bitch, lets see who gets the best!"",Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death ,Come here bitch!,Come here!,Take this motherfuckin dick!,Bitch, come here!,And as we go along,Throughout the days of our lives,We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday,That we must go through,These are the things that surround us through our atmosphere,Every day,Every single day the world keeps turning,keeps turning

Aiyyo what's up ,STOP, THEY KNOW IT'S US!!,,I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? ,I'm the one who burned your house down ,Well I'm out now ,And this time I'm comin back to blow your house up,And I ain't gon leave you a window to jump out of,Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms,And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms,And when I go to hell and I'm gettin ready to leave,I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe,'Cause this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil,And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people,He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal,Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel, See you in hell,Wall Street, Royce Da Five-Nine, Slim Shady,See you in hell for the sequel ,Bad Meets Evil, what? ,,And so that's the story when Bad Meets Evil,Two of the most wanted individuals in the county,Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens,It's too bad they had to go out the way they did,Got shot in the back comin out of that ol' saloon,But their spirits still live on till this day,Shhh... wait, did y'all hear that?,

Oh my God!, We're gonna have to shock him!, Oh my God!,These are the results of a thousand electric volts,A neck with bolts, ""Nurse we're losin' him, check the pulse!"",A kid who refused to respect adults,Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose,A corny lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery,'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me,And I might snap, one day just like that,I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack ,My first day in junior high, this kid said,""It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die"",I looked at my watch it was 1:20,""I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?!"",He said, ""Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse."",My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first,Something told me, ""Try to fake a stomach ache it works"",I screamed, ""Owww! My appendix feels like they could burst!,Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse!"", ""What's the matter?"", ""I don't know, my leg, it hurts!"", ""Leg?!?

Now once and for good."",I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could,And beat him over the head with it till I broke the wood,Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot,Made it home, later that same day,Started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray,I couldn't even see what I was tryin to read,I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed,My mother started screamin', ""What are you on, drugs?,Look at you, you're gettin blood all over my rug!"" ,She beat me over the head with the remote control,Opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull,I picked it up and screamed, ""Look bitch, what have you done?!?"", ""Oh my God, I'm sorry son"", ""Shut up you cunt!"",I said, ""Fuck it!"" Took it and stuck it back up in my head,Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck,Brain damage, ever since the day I was born,Drugs is what they used to say I was on,They say I never knew which way I was goin',But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song,Brain damage, ever since the day I was born,Drugs is what they used to say I was on,They say I never knew which way I was goin',But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song,Brain damage,It's brain damage,I got brain damage,It's brain damage,It's probably brain damage,It's brain damage,Brain damage,I got brain damage,It's brain damage

1997,Eminem,"Warning, this shit's gon be rated R, restricted,You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self inflicted,Doctor slapped my momma, ""Bitch you got a sick kid"",Arrested, molested myself and got convicted,Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises,Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis,I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyl,Disrespectful,Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo,""Murder Murder Redrum"",Brain size of a bread crumb,Which drug will I end up dead from,Inebriated, till my stress is eleviated,""How in the fuck can Eminem and shady be related?"",Illiterate, illigitimate shit spitter,Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder,Jumped out  killed the bitch and did her,Use to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was little'er,Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fuckin Bette Midler,Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler,Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler,Didn't Ya?  Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her,,I'm low down and I'm shiftee,And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack'em,And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from,,I lace tunes, I'm out this world like Space Moons,With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds,Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits,Doing whippits, passed out like Sanford snippits,Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it,I'ma let your grandpa hit it,Mix it up with cocaine so her can't forget it,Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum,But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum,So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage,Losing all of my leverage,Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich,Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage,Smoked out like ?,Band just making my neck itch,What the fuck? Gimme the tech bitch,You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast,Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips,Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips,Slap hips, support domestic violence,Beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence,I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen's really dust smoking?,If all your shit's missing, than probably one of us broke in,Chorus,My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling,Lit it like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England,I'm out the game, put the second string in,This Brandy got my swinging,Bobbing back and forth like a penguin,Delinquent, toking microphones with Broken English,Make your mama be like ""Ohh! This is good! Who sing this?"",""Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it,It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit."",It was predicted by a medic,I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic,Living off liquid Triametic,Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing,Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anasin,Frozen Manaquin, posted stiffer than a statue,I think I'm dying, God is that you?,Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP,Take me to ER ASAP for and IV,Motherfuck JOP, they don't support no hip hop,They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon come is Tupac,It's politics, it's all a fix,Setup by these white blue collared hicks,Just to make a dollar off of black music,With a subliminal ball of tricks,But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks,Chorus

That's what I'm talking about,Mother fucker just trying to get his pussy,Verse 2:,I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments,I used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense,Until the day I started following your feetprints,And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents,It made complete sense, there's someone else you like,So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike?,And you was like,  **I need a new nigga** ,Someone rich that I could follow,And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow,Leaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken hearted,I fell apart when you departed then the joking started,I was an open target, you play comedian,And I became the laughing stock. but now I'm on my feet again,And so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife,All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife,He goes, ""You didn't want me to see you then, I don't want you now"",Take a towel, wipe your brow, quit trying to hunt me down,You run me down and now your trying to apologize,For all the lies and every time you made me ball my eyes,Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it,Jealousy is in the house ya'll, Fellas sing it...,Chorus: Men Singing,Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy

1997,Eminem,"Yeah...ha ha ha , Yeah, Bizarre Kid comin' at you,Eminem and Fuzz, and Mr. Swifty, ha ha,No one's iller than me ,No one, no one is iller than me,No one is iller than me,It's Mr. Swifty from the 313...,I make rappers wanna turn into singers,I keep hoes lickin' they fingers,Bring this competition and face this meanin' ,Got your whole crew doing subpeonas,Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius,Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters,Keep it close, you can't beat us,While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this,I done made quadrapalegics outta these non-rappin rejects,While the whole world ejects your tape, it ain't no secret,That your shit sounds fake, you can't stop it my mind state,Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate,I'm like Two-Face, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell,From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like route canals,I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail,Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well,Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linkin' trials,Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels,Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now,Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?,I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild,Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW!,It's Swifty from the 313,Like I said no one is iller than me, unnhh!,Me and Eminem and Mike,Drivin' down Van Dyke,Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite,Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason,Should be takin' my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facin',Last week this old man I had to blast,Cuz he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas,Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook,Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook,Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack,Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at,I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should,This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good!,Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route ,Throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell ""EVERYBODY GET OUT""!,My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece,Cuz she found out I was havin' an affair with her 10-year old niece,No one, no one's iller than me,It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313,No one, no one is iller than me,It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313,Nobody better test me, cuz I don't wanna get messy,Especially when I step inside this bitch, dick freshly,New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs,Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs,True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs,Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs,Down a fifth, crack open a six,I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss,I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends,Who gives a fuck who they was,I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does,They probably don't be packin' anyways, do they Fuzz?,We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz,Mics get sandblasted,Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid,Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it,Fuckin' felon, headed to hell in a handbasket,Talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted,Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic,Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic,Furious four motherfuckers,Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters,Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me,I run shit like an ass with legs,Massive lead to leave your cabbage red,Similar to your ass in a casket dead,Drastic spread of acid heads,Come to abort you like a bastard egg,That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs,Ask the feds from past the edge,Rockin' the most classic threads,Flashin' bread, roll down the window,Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red,You can get 'til that ass get red,Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him,I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem,Never writer's block, I block writers,My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters,Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick,Some bitch ran up screamin' GET THE COPS QUICK!,And got drop kicked, now she screamin' ""Stop it..."",Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit,Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scooter '97 crop pick,Sick a-ya'll niggaz lookin' at me like I got tits,I shoot a rocket through your optic,You niggaz still don't know the top pick?,I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass,And have you shittin' socks bitch!,We rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split,Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits,,Ain't nobody iller than me,It's the Mr. Fuzzy

In life that is,To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit,You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night,You say it's gonna stop but it..  just.. slows.. down,And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this,Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be,You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that,When you got niggas hiding in your closet,I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely,Verse 3: 3,I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me,So I stepped on it and then asked my homies,And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas,Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number,I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said ""Hey Bitch..,Haven't I seen you before?"", looked at my nigga,Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands,And said ""Oh it's like that?"",She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit,She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit,She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number,She asked could I give her mine two,Got to the crib and called her up,We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck,I said ""Maxine check this out,,Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out"",Got to the crib she let me in,She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom,I said ""Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things"",What the fuck are you doing?,So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing,As she went for my midsection,I threw her down as I tore off her shirt,Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work,Before I hit it she said,""3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass"",I said ""What is it, another nigga?  It's ok"",She said ""No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS"",I got up out,Denaun: Hey, Maxine,Maxine: What,Denaun: You thinking about sucking my dick?,Maxine: Yeah for a small price,Denaun: For a small price? What you mean?,Maxine: You know, money nigga,Denaun: You don't need no damn money,,I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit.,Maxine:  What you, what you hear I got?,Denaun: AIDS,Maxine:  Who told you that bullshit?,Denaun: My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie,Maxine: Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then,Denaun: Oh for real, it's like that?,Maxine:  Well I ain't got shit,,so he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me,,I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga,Denaun: Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you,Maxine: No, see..,Denaun: You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you,Maxine: Hold on, why it ain't even like that,Denaun: I want ya'll to get paid, fucking..,Maxine:
