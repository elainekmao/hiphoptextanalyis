She's just wouldn't,Make believe what she can do indeed,You're dealing with the Queen of Speed,Cuttin' the beats with ease, makin' the record bleed,Now then, you know what I mean...,CHORUS,She's the Inch Lord on the mixboard,Put your tape on pause and press record,Never does the same cut twice in one night,She'll go solo toe-to-toe like a vice,Grip the turntable and flip the record over,Heat up the party like a supernova,Because she's a girl don't mean jack,If Jill tried to get ill, she'd get slapped,Wanna know her name and why she came?,Not to cause trouble but to entertain,I'm-a tell ya don't mistake her for a fella,The mix empress...Spinderella!,Yeah, that's her title,The God of Speed is her DJ idol,Cuttin' like a maniac, clever as a brainiac,Only when the scene's packed will she react to,Anyone who dares to compare,The comp will be too much too bear,But this chick is big on tricks,With her wrist she'll flip within a spilt,Second, she's flexin' and checkin',The level of the power meter will not be less than,Ten degrees, her sound won't distort,Mixin' ain't a job to her it's a sport,When the turntable speaks, take my advice,My homegirl is nicer than nice,She's a captive, a slave to the rhythm,If the crowd wants action then she'll give 'em,More than they can handle, this ain't a scandal,If the mix is mangled she'll untangle,It with a scratch on it, ain't that a blip?,The way she can switch from groove to groove,With no room to improve ,CHORUS,Cuts are made to be played not saved,Spin won't behave if she ain't paid,To get down, no let down,Put your bets down and just check how,She moves with the grace of a cat,The impact of wax hits hard as a bat,Automated just like automation,Imitation causes irritation,You owe it to yourself to see her,Go backstage and meet her,Get her autograph, take a photograph,I know that's too much to ask,Word, but don't give up hope,Spinderella's not a fella, Spinderella's dope,CHORUS
