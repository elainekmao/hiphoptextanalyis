I don't have a clue,Then she said the lucky man is you,I dropped my brew,And everything looked fuzzy,Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy,She said yeah remember that date,I thought back and tried to calculate,Then I said damn are you sure it's mine,Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times,She said that day no I wasn't whoring,Your ass is mine that's when the sweat started pouring,Cause all I saw was ice cube in court,Paying a gang on child support,Then I thought deep about giving up the money,What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy,Naw cause then I'd really get faded,That's murder one cause it was premeditated,So what I'm a do,I don't have a clue,How many months left damn only two,I'm gettin faded,No cigar, g,Ay yo homey man I'm getting faded,It's crazy cause before I could sleep with her,I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her,See the booty and the front was all in place,But the girl had the pitbull face,So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid,Oh lord God forbid,My homies see me at the motel,Cause those fools would love to just go tell,Everybody in the hood that knows your rep,So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept,And hold your big fat butt steady,Cause yo hoe I got the paper bag ready,She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey,I knocked the boots from here to albuquerque,I dropped her off man and I'm knowing,That I'm a hate myself in the morning,I got drunk to help me forget,Yo another day another hit shit,I'm gettin faded,Ay yo you know what time it is,Nine months later she's ready to drop the load,And everybody in the hood already knows,It's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me,You know ice cube can't be having that g,I'm thinking to myself why did I bang her,Now I'm in the closet looking for the hanger,Jd and jinx and t-bone won't let up they won't shut up,I'm gettin fed up bitch,Cause I know you're tryin to break me,But if I find out your tryin to fake me,I'm a buff that duff for a hoot,Beat ya down and leave a crown or two,That night she went into labor,And the shit is getting kinda major,The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver,Looking like my next-door neighbor,She said it was mine that was her best guess,But let's check the results of the blood test,I started smiling yeah cause it read negative,Damn why did I let her live? ,After that I should've got the gat,And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap,But no I just told the hoe who laid me,Excuse me bitch it's a switch,You can't fade me,Naw baby not this way,Yo you ain't playing ice cube out like no booger,I don't fall for the okey-doke,And before I fall for the okey-doke,I let the pistol smoke,Now sing it,Yeah baby you can't fade me,Naw unfadable baby

1992,Ice Cube,"Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank God,I don't know but today seems kinda odd,No barkin' from the dog, no smog,And mama cooked a breakfast with no hog,I got my grub on but didn't pig out,Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out,Hooked it up on later as I hit the do',Thinking ""Will I live another twenty-fo'?"",I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top,And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop,Had to stop at a red light,Looking in my mirror, not a jacker in sight,And everything is alright,I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night,Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all,""Which court are y'all playin' basketball?"",Get me on the court and I'm trouble,Last week, fucked around and got a triple double,Freaking niggas every way like M.J.,I can't believe today was a good day,Drove to the pad and hit the showers,Didn't even get no static from the cowards,'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me,Saw the police and they rolled right past me,No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction,As I ran the intersection,Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' ,What's the haps on the craps?,Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em,Roll 'em in a circle of niggas and watch me break 'em,With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven,Seven even back do' Little Joe,I picked up the cash flow,Then we played bones and I'm yellin' ""Domino!"",Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.,Today was a good day,Left my nigga's house paid,Picked up a girl I been tryin' to fuck since the twelfth grade,It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic,The Lakers beat the SuperSonics,I felt on the big fat fanny,Pulled out the jammy and killed the punanny,And my dick runs deep, so deep, so deep,Put her ass to sleep,Woke her up around one,She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube ""The Top Gun"",Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting,Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion,I was glad everything had worked out,Dropped her ass off and then chirped out,Today was like one of those fly dreams,Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams,No helicopter looking for a murder,Two in the morning, got the fat burger,Even saw the lights of the Goodyear blimp,And it read ""Ice Cube's a pimp."",Drunk as hell but no throwing up,Halfway home and my pager still blowing up,Today, I didn't even have to use my AK,I got to say, it was a good day,Hey wait, wait a minute, fool,Stop the shit,What the fuck am I thinking about?

'Cause I'm down in a suit and tie,They killed a homie that I went to school with ,I tell ya life ain't shit to fool with,I still hear the screams of his mother,While my nigga laid dead in the gutter ,And it's getting to my temple,Why is that the only time black folks get to ride in a limo?,It makes me so mad I want to get my sawed-off,And have some bodies hauled off,But no, I pay my respects and I'm through ,Hug my crew, and maybe shed a tear or two,And I wanna get blitz,Grab my 40 ounce and then I reminisce,About a brother who had to be the one and only,So I dedicate this to my dead homiez...,Verse Two:,Another homie got murdered on a shakedown {three gun shots},And his mother is at the funeral, havin' a nervous breakdown,Two shots hit him in the face when they blasted {two gun shots},A framed picture and a closed casket,A single file line about 50 cars long,All drivin' slow with they lights on,He got a lot of flowers and a big wreath,What good is that when you're six feet deep?,I look at that shit and gotta think to myself,And thank God for my health,'Cause nobody really ever know,When it's gonna be they family on the front row,So I take everything slow, go with the flow,Shut my motherfuckin' mouth if I don't know,'Cause that's what Pops told me,But I wish he could have said it...to my dead homiez,Verse Three:,I remember we painted our names on the wall for fun,Now it's ""Rest in Peace"" after every one,Except me, but I ain't the one to front,Seems like I'm viewin' a body after every month,Plus, I knew him when he was yea big,Pour beer on the curb before I take a swig,But somethin' ain't right,And it's a tragedy, that's the only time that the family's tight,Lovin' each other in a caring mood,There's lots of people and lots of food,They say ""Be Strong"" and you're tryin',But how strong can you be when you see your Pops cryin'?,So that's why Ice Cube's dressed up,Because the city is so fuckin' messed up,And everybody is so phony,Take a little time...to think about your dead homiez.

1990,Ice Cube,",Well two bees in a bucket,Mother motherfuck it,You either flavor flav it,Or you chuck chuck chuck it,Kiss my ass or suck a d.i.c.-,K. stands for kill so don't fuck with me,I fucked that lady in the bed,I missed that pussy and I bust a spread,I tried it again in a thumping wagon,The bottom fell out and her ass started dragging,Tried it again and I failed to grasp,I missed that pussy and I bust my ass,Then I fucked this lady in the tree,The baby came out and said ""run-dmc"",,I knew this girl who looked just like you,Light brown and a fly hair-do,I wanted to do her, screw her,So I stepped to her,On-key bitch had more ass than a donkey,I said you're the type of girl that I can't pass over,Give me one chance and I'll bend your ass over,Just call me the plumber at the end of the night,Cause a nigga like me'll lay plenty of pipe,She didn't get offended it was splendid to me,Cause mister nice guy is what I pretended to be,I guess I just wine her and dine her,And by the end of the night I'll be behind her,Waxing that ass like rain dance,On the bumper get the pussy then I dump her,Took her to the comfort inn,Tucked her in,Pulled out the third leg pumped it in,She said will you call me,Yeah I'll call you a bitch or a hoe after I ball ya,Naw I'm just playin but it's still the same,Cause a nigga like ice cube is only out for one thang
