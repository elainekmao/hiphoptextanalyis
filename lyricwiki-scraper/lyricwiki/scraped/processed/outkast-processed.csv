never primary concern,Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn,I'd meet muslims, gangstas, bitches, rastas, and macaroni niggaz - imposters,So on a trip to New York on some beeswax,I get invited to a club where emcees at,And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head,Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreds with,Which I was rocking at the time,When I was going through them phases trying to find,Anything that seemed real in the world,Still searching, but I started liking this girl,Now you know her,As Erykah on and on Badu,Call Tyrone on the phone why you,Do that girl like that boy you ought to be ashamed,The song wasn't about me and that ain't my name,We're young, in love, in short we had fun,No regrets no abortion, had a son,By the name of Seven,And he's five,By the time I do this mix, he'll probably be six,You do the arithmetic,Me do the language arts,Y'all stand against the wall blindfolded me throw the darts,To poke you in the heart,And take you from the start,To one luxury transportation and a Marta card,Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays,Momma or her daddy let her borrow the Benz because she's smart,Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor,And he sells you that rabbit that's been sitting in his yard,You fix it up.. you trick it out.. you give it rims.. you give it bump,You give it all your time because that's all you can think about,..And that's as far as I got,,And that's as far as I got, and where I wanted to go,knowing the whole time that's all you could think about,even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up,you need a jump like you'll need in your rump to grow,and you change all the time so that rabbit that you thought about,that whole summer, the next summer you didn't want that rabbit no more,you wanted something bigger and better,So the summer past and the rabbit is old?,Right, right, so now you want a Cadillac...
