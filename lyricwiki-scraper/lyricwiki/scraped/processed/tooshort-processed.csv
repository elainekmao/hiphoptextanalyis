where the strong control the fake,He was known around for all the time,Everybody went wild when he said his rhyme,Said his manly man would come out,With his gangsta ride his turn back side,Out like Jessie Jackson in a land ,Where game that controls the lane,Yes the wild wild west that's the place,Suckers take a bite and don't even taste,The California lifestyle that I live,When the sun rolls out

were all his friends all his fans,Walk right up and make his man,And you always knew everytime,Sucker emcee's wish they could rhyme,Just like pimp but what's the fact,The fact they just couldn't get

dope,Cause in this town, it's goin on,And brothers doin that can't live too long,So what's my option, do it or not,Break a hoe, sell a ki, just don't get caught,Cause if I do, I'm goin to jail,On a one-way ticket to a prison cell,So why commit the crime? don't ask me,Went to school everyday, and I still can't read,I count money like a champ, now ask me,Why everyday does the task force jack me,The story's been told one million times,About a boy growin up to a life of crime,I heard it before, you heard it too,But now, homeboy, it's just me and you,You see, people try to call us filthy trash,Even though we live better and make mo' cash,Than they do, I'm not a no-good thug,Standin on the corner sellin drugs,And just remember, this ain't multiple choice,Without a college degree you only got your voice,You gotta talk for yours, or get nothin at all,This ain't the nba, I ain't havin a ball,Every day is a trip, but I ain't trippin,Watch my back and don't start slippin,Money won't talk, but it looks right back,Everytime I dip into my stack,I'm buyin cars, jewelries, and mobile phones,Things I couldn't get with a high school diploma,It's alright, cause I just help myself,You should know, cause I can't do nothin else,And you better watch out for the day,When you lock me up and throw that key away,Cause I'll be back on parole,Ain't changed nothing, cause I'm ready to roll,I go to school now, but just to front,Still servin dopefiends what they want,Count 5 to 10, 10 to 20,And I just keep on makin money,I hope you don't think my story's amazin,I tell it to a kid in the ghetto, it won't faze him,So many blackmen die for drugs,I think back on the way life was,Before rock cocaine started runnin thangs,And drive-by shootings was a normal thang,Before brothers bought benzes, used to drive mustangs,12 years later, and I'm still in the game,All my life all I wanted was a few hoes,If I was pimpin or slingin at the liquor sto',Ain't nothin but street life, fuck that school,All the squares up there ain't even cool,Plus my partners at the house sell coke all day,Hit the mall like players, spendin fat-ass bank,Junior high wasn't shit but a place to fight,Muthafuckas wasn't learnin how to read and write,I'm just walkin down the street all alone,High as hell, my mind is gone,I'm thinkin bout some brand-new shit and I'm broke,I know I be a fiend if I smoke that coke,But if I go back to school and get educated,Be a old-ass man before I graduated,So what should I do, I can't even cope,I guess I'll get a sack and start slingin dope,I went to my homie, said, give me the sack,He disappeared quick, and he came right back,He said, you owe me a g, I give you a week,You fuck up my money, don't cop no plead,Cause in the oak ain't no love, $hort,I knew right then I couldn't sell that coke,When I was young, it was hard to tell,If I grow up and be rich as hell,See, I was cool I knew all the shit,Big bank on my finger tips,But I never had a big bank, not back then,I kicked back and watched all my friends,Make big money, right in my face,And if you ever crossed them, they be on your case,You go under, six feet underground,You gets no love from the oaktown,,I drive my top everyday like a movie star,Drive around all night in old towed up cars,And if you stop me, ain't no tellin what you find in my trunk,Gotta live like this, cause I ain't no punk,So break down the dank and roll up that shit,Light the muthafucka, take a fat-ass hit,My fingers all sticky from the residue,Don't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you,Cause life is only give and take,In the town where the strong control the fake,The wild wild west, that's the place,Suckers take a bite, and don't even taste,The california lifestyle that I live,Mack these hoes every chance I get,Like a drop sl, three times black,I'm a pimp, a player and I been known to mack,I'm a muthafucka, I broke your heart,She gave it all to me, and I tore it apart,Talked about love right to the end,But I broke your heart and, bitch, I do it again,So young and tender, also fine,Tryin to get short dog all the time,I take what I want, you can keep the rest,You gets no love from east oakland, bitch,That's the place I call home,Where the oakland city players roam,Game don't stop, listen to me,Everybody fuckin with the o.p.d.,Slingin cocaine, knockin it off,Killed some nigga, and he never got caught,High-speed chases everyday,Can't make no money no other way,A bitch yelled raid!, that ain't true,Cause you laid down, and she fucked you,Two days ago I didn't know she existed,But now baby is just one of my bitches,I don't care what you say,Cause I catch bitches and straight get pay,You don't care what I'm sayin,Punk-ass square ain't got no game,Hoes love me, cause I'm a player,They think maybe I just might fuck em later,I keep mackin though, I don't work for free,To be a true hoe you gotta pay me,I spend endless days and endless nights,Plottin this shit to keep my money right,I build stages in my mind, and it's all an act,All I'm tryin to do is keep my pockets fat,With this pimp game, and these funky beats,Now here's a little story from the oakland streets,You see, tania had a boyfriend, his name was jack,Always had the bitches on their backs,Jack told tania, I love you so,But jack's a mack, he's got several hoes,One day she beeped him to say what's up,He didn't call back, cause she was only out to fuck,She beeped mike, cause she got mad,She knew about the bitches her boyfriend had,Mike called back, and he was on his way,He just got the pussy yesterday,You see, mike ain't trippin on his girlfriend,Fine little bitch, I think her name is lynn,Mike paid the bills always in cash,And if she ever got raw, he just beat that ass,It goes on y'all, so don't even trip,You gets no love from east oakland, bitch,Got sprung, even though it's not legal,A young black man livin like rich people,I got this game from a hard-ass place,It's on the map, right there in your face,I see my people, all filled with joy,Next day they're killin homeboys,Can't say shit if you sho' can't shoot,Cause muthafuckas will smoke them boots,You gets no love from oakland, bitch,You better try to make me rich

2000,Too $hort,",Yeah baby you know whassup,Tryin to get this money girl,I'ma take you out to Las Vegas, put you to work,Show you how to get this real money, youknowhatI'msayin?,Chorus: {singers} repeat 2X,I can't wait til next Friday ,That's when a brother gets paid ,I've got plenty to drink, plenty to smoke,That's what I'm out here hustlin fo',,We all need to be strong, for the ones we love,Cain't hesitate to help the next man up,Pass the game like it's a hot potato,Gotta do it now and not later,You wanna say somethin, preach it,If you know somethin, teach it,Cause it makes no sense to keep it to yourself,That's how you felt,well you might feel better if you spread yo' wealth,Let it trickle down.. cause yo' crumbs,might be just enough for me to get some,I'm tryin to come up, you know I'm comin,but it's hard for a black man without a good woman,If you find one it might be your last chance,You ain't never gon' hold down a black man,You need to choose me, get this money you can have me,Ride in my Caddy, and call me daddy,Chorus,,You've got yo' momma, you know how that is,A good mother's gon' do anything for her kids,But you never kenw your father, he never bothered,Your last boyfriend used to grab you by the collar,for nothin, wasn't even tryin to get money,Fine woman like you, I don't find the shit funny,You need management, not an amateur pimp,who don't know what to do, when the money ain't cool,I'm a hustler, I always eat good,Fat house in the hood, new shoe on my foot,Things ain't been the same since he put you out,Somethin you ain't never felt good about,Let's get this money, that's what I want you for,Don't make me wait too long, cause life is too short,She said gladly, and then she had me,Jumped in my Caddy, and called me daddy,Chorus,,You tryin to convince yo'self it's the right thing,Once upon a time you had nice dreams,Now you don't sleep good, whatchu thinkin of?,Nobody cain't tell you how to get that love,It's right here, I know you understand me,I'll be your daddy, I'll be your whole family,No stress, never have to worry bout a thing,The best resteraunts, furs and diamond rings,All paid for by the suckers and lames,All you need is me in this motherf**kin game,To the top, that's where we goin,Where the good green don't stop growin,Don't ever turn on me,Give me everything you earn for me,Be together forever, never lonely,Smoke my last weed, a big fattie,Ride in my Caddy, and call me daddy,Chorus

2000,Too $hort,"Little girls of the world, you're all so sprung,15, 16 and all so young,I thought about you just last night,Grabbed my pen then I started to write,A rap that'll cap like a true blue rap,Not a washed-up almost mc sap,Little girls so fresh and I know you are,Wanna take a little ride in my new car,I see you more than baby, it's more like hell,You screw a little girl and end up in jail,Even though she seems she's 19,You're looking at her body an it's breaking the jeans,Well you know she's not, so don't play dumb,Little girls walking round trying to give me some,But I tell 'em like this, I'm the player $hort,Playing freaks like you is just a sport,I'm coming way too real and I can never be funny,Niggas like me just want your money,Give it up, cause I'm no lost cause,Little girl recognize too $hort's the boss,When they turn 16, we all find out,What little girls like that are all about,So you girls out there, that fit my rhyme,You'd better think twice before you jump on mine,Little girl's so thick, you might think she's grown,But if you knew when she was born, you might leave her alone,She's trouble homeboy, with a big fat t,Little girls like that make old men pee,Then a brother like me might break my neck,Looking back saying ooooh! bout to get in a wreck,Cause she's always flirting, might give me a look,Like I put her in the oven and she started to cook,But when I put her on the spot, she could not hang,With my so rough, so tough playboy game,I only said two words, something like get busy,Her head started hurting and she got real dizzy,Growing up to fast, all you little girls,Letting brothers like me cold crush your world,Should've listen to your momma when she told you so,But you wnet and got g'd now you want some more,They ain't paying me money, talking bout love,And the other girl's who I'm thinking of,Can you understand, I'm just a man,I want to come in this world and cold take the man,So just step on back, while I walk on by,I might look you down, and I might say hi,And if you come up choosing, I just might laugh,Say little girl check me out in about two and a half...years,I took a little girl to a drive in show,Jumped in the back and heard no no no,She was only 16 but the girl was ripe,36-24 and a 35,I was wasting time spitting lines,Thinking bout going home cold getting mine,Baby said stop it I said drop it,I tried everything but I could not cop it,I was going to a store about a month ago,Met another girl that just loved my show,We talked for a while and it was all about,Having big fun later on at her house,She said her pops was gone but her mother was there,And everything was cool cause she don't care,So I gave her a ride, kissed her goodbye,I said I'd be back and we all know why,Went to find my thrill up on that hill,I was coming right back with the power drill,I had fun for a while but it wasn't enough,When it all got good, her pops showed up,He must have walked in the room and said young punk,Cause when he walked in the room, he smelled the funk,Then he tried to mash, but I don't play,Cause I was out of that window and on my way,Little girl,Every night you call and say come by,You tell me things changed and I know you lie,I came by last week, you said drive on up,And your pops came out talking all that stuff,Next night we made a date for 9 o'clock,And I always wondered why you walked the block,I saw you waiting on the corner when I made the turn,I didn't really think about it cause I wasn't concerned,I said, you look so good, but you always do,I was rushing to the house for the old 1 2's,But the ones ain't cool, and the twos don't work,Every time I tried, you kept saying it hurts,And then it all came out under all your tears,It seems you only been alive for 15 years,You could have fooled me baby with your lying scheme,Said you worked in the mall and just turned 18,When it came down to it, I couldn't go through it,It's all so sad cause you wanted to do it,Little girl, you want to have some fun,You'd better wait a few years cause you're much too young,Stop playing games, you might find a guy,Who will like you for yourself, not for all your lies,So I put it like this, and I don't play,If I see your young ass, I'm not going your way,You little girl

way,Playboy $hort was ready to play,I bumped to this girl, her name was roseanne,We hitted the motel and got it goin' on,Holiday inn to the break of dawn,When I took baby home, I freaked her mom,I knew this tender named shanie,I took her to the house and let her freak on me,Baby was a fan, she loved my beat,But I wouldn't raise my leg to let her kiss my feet,I met this freak named yolanda,Rolled baby doll like a brand new honda,I was on top and she was up under,The bed hitted the wall and it sounded like thunder,I once had a datewith girl named kitty,She was so fine with big fat tiddies,All night long she was actin' shitty,So I macked on baby like I was frank nitti,There's another girl, her name is rose,I use to roll baby like brand new volvos,I never saw rose wearin' clothes,She's a pimp house pet, ready to pose,I was ridin' down the street when I met janet,Her booty was bigger than the whole damn planet,Ass everywhere, I just can't stand it,Tried to poem it but I could not manage,I had this freak, her name was bunny,Said I was the only man who ever called her honey,Everythin' I did to her was funny,I macked on bunny and I took her money,Eight tonight a date with shirlie,She was really short and her hair was curly,If you saw baby you liked this girlie,She was so fine I went to get her early,Shirlie was freakin' like a girl named rachel,Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal,She liked to kiss all on my neval,Those are her lips on top of my label,I knew another freak, her name was candy,Real big lips and they came in handy,I smooth got worked and it was so dandy,I hooked the brood up with my homeboy randy,He did me a favor in return,Gave me a lizard, said her name was laverne,Baby got tossed and I got it on,I grabbed the mic and started to sing my song,My young homeboy heard me rap,And said he had way more freaks than that,So I told him like this: they might be freakin',But, boy, you never had that t-p-treatment...

wouldn't stop till he got a benz,I never thought about it till the other day,He had drop chop rolling away,In a eighty five or eighty seven,Said he got paid cuz he raps like this,You could see it in his eyes he was seeing stars,Choosing folks and having things,Just checking out the girls walking down the street,In the wild wild west that's where you see,The freshest emcees you will say is soft,From seventy five girl so raw,Like silky they and hollywood,They come so fresh cuz you know they could,Like sir Too $hort when I'm on the mic,West coast rappers rap all long night,So watch how you talk in the wild wild west,East coast rappers make us look fresh,With the save a hoe and everybody scream,East coast rappers make all the cream,With a New York rap and a New York slang,Not too many could spit that game,Now the time has come and I'll tell it right,About a rapper like me who will rock the mic,I'm making you wake up on the western coast,Were giving you more than just the locs,Its everything you could never have,Took and spent your money to buy my rap,The wild wild west that's what its called,About the west coast rappers that stand so tall,The freshest emcees you'll say you saw,From seventy five girl so raw,Wild wild west
