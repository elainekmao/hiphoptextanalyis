NO DATE E-40:Its All Bad,E-40,",,Why was I born in these trifling ass times?,Why is it mandatory that I carry knives?,Don't be to civil cuz even white folks get jacked to,Doctors, high class lawyers and even Japs too,You ask me why I speak the real the way I feel,How come we call bitches hoes and you call us nigeros?,They want to do me like they did Stacks,What is this young black man doing with all that scratch? huh,I see some timahs on the yayo track readin they mail,Talking bout ""I got white girl for sale"",But they ain't talking to me cuz I'm an oldie and they knows that,I used to be just like them I tell them ""y'all get that scratch"",Magazine was never nothing like Bel Air,High speed shot outs and shit but I loved it there
