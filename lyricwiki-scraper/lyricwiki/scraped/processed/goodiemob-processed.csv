But I got my crew,Didn't come fo' no beef cause I don't eat steak,I got a plate of soul food chicken, rice and gravy,,Not covered in too much.  Drinking a cup of punch-,Tropical-every last Thursday of the month,:,Daddy put the hot grits on my chest in the morning,When I was sick, Mary had the hot soup boiling,Didn't know why, but it felt so good,Like some waffles in that morning,Headed back to the woods,Now I'm full as tick.  Got some soul on blast in the cassette,Food for my brain.  I haven't stopped learning yet,Hot wings from Mo-Joes.  Got my forehead sweating,Celery and blue cheese on my menu next,,Southern Fry won't allow my body to lie still,Tied face goons surround me like cancer,Drill me with second-hand obstacles,But, only to make matters worse,Plus, I'm getting pimped by this temp lady Jackie,From Optima: staffing figure.  Laughing,Shut up clown.  Don't talk to me like that,Looking stupid of course.  Living day by day,And you ain't hard trick?  Hell you say?,,It's such a blessing when my eyes get to see the sun rise,I'm ready to begin,Another chance to get further away from where I've been,But I'll never forget,Every thing I went through, I appreciate the shit,Because if I had of went and took the easy way,,I wouldn't be the strong nigga that I am today,Every thing that I did, different things I was told,,Just ended up being food for my soul,,Come and get yo' soul food, well well,Good old-fashioned soul food, all right,Everythang is for free,As good as it can be,Come and get some soul food,,Sunday morning where you eating at?,I'm on 1365 Wichita Drive.,Old Bird working the stove right?,Church's dripping chicken in yesterday's grease,Didn't go together with this quart of Mickey's,Last night hanging over from a good time,Yeah, beef is cheaper, ,But it's pumped with ""red dye"" between two pieces of bread,Shawty look good with them hairy legs,Wish I could cut her up, but my stomach come before sex,A house full of hoes.  Now what's the ingredient:,Spaghetti, plus her monthly flow,:,They know they making it hard on the yard,Fuck Chris Darden!  Fuck Marsha Clark!,Taking us when we're in the spotlight for a joke,Changing by the day.   I see it's getting bigger in my square,Looking at Lenox from the outside,With a stare.  No money to go inside,Tameka and Tiffany outside tripping and skipping rope ,to the beats from my jeep,As I speak, ""Whats up"" from the driver seat,,A heaping helping of fried chicken, ,macaroni and cheese and collard greens,Too big for my jeans,Smoke steams from under the lid that's on the pot,Ain't never had a lot.

On the fortress walls, there is no letters,Buddha say, the Bloods are strictly outnumbered,They beseiged on the beats, Goodie Mo-B, run the creeps,Y'all can have the streets, asphault caught many suckers,Slippin on wet floors, we puttin out the signs,On krokers, C-I, T-Y, such a pity,Bein suckled dry, like a newborn,On his momma's titty before I retired I hit twenty,True to cellulite with big ?room pesquite? on the porch,Poundin', like cartoon Ennis, old school efforts,Through the Sunday down, Crenshaw sparkin,Zoned out, off the ink, for life,Goin through time and metal detectors, I can't take my weapon,And I can't be no dope dealer,'Cause they be done put a hit out on a nigga, plus I can't keep up,With them keys, locked in the fo'-do',Backseat drivers havin out-of-body experiences,Wakin up, somewhere else,Still standing,Yeah, each and every element that exists in this,Universe is manifested from a thought first,Through the inner mind's eye of the unseen power in the sky,Gave birth to Mother Earth and all it's worth to you and I,This most loved invention, my conciousness is an extension of Him,Yet I'm flesh and bone with a mind of my own,To dig deeper than the surface, whether I learn,From your upcomings or your downfalls we all have individual purpose,It's amazing, how the streets do the majority of raising,Of children who end up dead before hearing what you said,And it's sad, so all I can write about is what I had,Interpretations of life good and bad with a pen and pad,It seems like abortion, when I just write a small portion,It's either crumpled up or torn without lettin the thought be born,Young minded, and blinded in those days,I didn't want to have a thought that I couldn't raise, nurture, and care for,Be there for, help prepare for, the times ahead,When someone doesn't agree with what is said, huh,And if they did, don't get all arrogant 'cause that's my kid,Just be thankful that it's good and somebody overstood,Now, the listener in here want the same flow but I gotta let it grow,Clever enough to let it go, if I don't wanna rap no mo',And I'll make sure that no one ever forgets,It's immortalized forever, on wax, CD's and casettes,And when someone goes to the store and purchases it for ten,The life cycle starts all over again,And I was granted this music as my soulmate to procreate,And give back what I was given, a life worth livin',And I, am still standing, unscathed,Pain is for suckers to feel,MC's are running out of things to say, and,Radio stations running out of songs to play, shit,We still standing, unscathed,And pain is for suckers to feel, huh,And MC's running out of things to say

that's that game,Won't try to explain,From books to bricks,Now I look, see crooks and tricks,Caught up in the mix,Of everyday in every way but the right,I control the substance my people fiend for at

the first roll,Don't let the streets rock and roll yo soul,Swats GA by way of Cascade Heights,Gunshots, roadblocks, sidewalks and ice,Sold me out for 3.5 grams of neighborhood clout,Now what the fucks we bout,I'm back home from the bullshit,Puttin in work,Meanwhile others dug ditches and covered themselves in dirt,One squirt,And you locked down forever,Can't run from reality,Lurking you closer and closer away,To the same old traps,Now you never learn from your mistakes,So now you wear this ass whoopin wit pride,What side you on?,It wasn't no I in team,Only in your dreams,Saturated with schemes,Yea you right, God gon' deal wit ya,Fallin from his grace,Rookie cop moves cause shifty game,And 30 days I'm blessed in the hole,But that's till I go to the state federal penitentiary,Yea I could did my time standin on one feet,But see I fucked up royally,Thought I was slick,Them herpes-havin ass crackers changed my big check to six,Times wit Dean Whitaker's sermon of the day,But when I go to sleep I don't dream no more I just lay,A wise man knows his limitations,Concrete, concrete like Greg Street,Sufferin' from a severe case of inner-city blues,I ain't got no clues to which directions I need to choose,This opportunity to gain is all I got to lose,I just can't settle for these streets shawty I refuse,That's the shit I like,Lord got the door shot down to the pavement,Remove yo hat under the ceiling of this building,A rebuff from the usher of sorts,Because ????,Most strive for the diamonds and overlook the gems,Got skimp wit yo bags,Boulders become shoulders to depend on,Which way to explore,Reform, refrain, we gain in flame,Every thought you walk through the trails is hell,Airborne for ????,Clone me, replace me with me,Another nation inside a nation,Out the land of Scots,Suction cups to test tube,Layer of skin,Supply the crust ,And we'll mix the fruit,Gunshows supplied me in the hour of need,Watch 'em bleed,Aryan nation be the dealer,Now who's the killer,Yup yup that's the shit I like,That's the shit I like,Uh puttin forth the effort to make a change,Not doin a lot of talkin bout it what's yo game?,You slippin you can't never do that,That's when you get jacked,For yo life over emotions runnin' wild ,Like salamanders swimmin in southwest creeks,Feelin incomplete, another story,Livin ????,Value lost, it wasn't worth it look what it costed,Your life young nigga,Didn't go out without a fight behind the gun trigger,Better think fast or get swept off yo feet,Nigga it hurts to see these drugs deteriorate,The minds of knuckleheads that want to be base heads,Don't say I didn't tell you 'casue you gon see in the future,I hope I don't have to shoot you,If you switch,Went from hardcore to beggin like a bitch,Revolutions good to bad,Hoods to rags real niggas to fags,What's the news?,But I refuse to lose,Sufferin' from a severe case of inner-city blues,I ain't got no clues to which directions I need to choose,This opportunity to gain is all I got to lose,I just can't settle for these streets shawty I refuse,Well I woke up this mornin with the same frustration from situations like these,Got a call about some work from one of them temporary agencies,No high school diploma or any college degrees,I can't enlist but they'll draft me if there's a war overseas,Oh please, of course I can slice some OZs,But see I'm one of those aspirin MCs,And uh bills are due so at times I'm doubtful and everyone disagrees,But I'd rather struggle on my feet than to live on my knees,So my uniform tight workin all night at Mickey D's,Got about 90 dollars and some change after the government get they fees,These minimum wages ain't enough to feed my babies,Purposely these limitations on black folks opportunities,So I quit cuz I'm tired of being one of those overworked, underpaid employees,Stop carin at all went on and did a few small burglaries,It seems like my faith done turned into forgotten memories,And I ain't gettin away with nothing because I know he always sees,But see right now I need to see how I can get this here dope sold,I done stuffed in my pocket as many rocks as it can hold,They gon get high so I'ma get my money even though it's freezin cold,Now how many times you done heard this story told?,Believe it or not, it's some very intelligent junkies,But dependencies is eatin away at they souls like disease,Anyone can turn into somebody who covets and envies,Unequal economics can easily make you some enemies,And the crime rate never drops to the cops ride around in threes,I knew he would have killed me if I did anything but freeze,They found the rest of the dope in some nearby shrubberies,In a dimlit room being questioned by these authorities,And they gave me some time in correctional facilities,And now my woman's gotta take on a man's responsibilities

1995,Goodie Mob,"I'm so happy we made it,I knew one day we would,All these years of strugglin',Were never understood,Now my eyes are open,And I can clearly see,We didn't die for nothin','Cause we're finally free,My Grand be gone after a 103 years of blood sweat and pain,And never complained,The last words that the nurse heard was the song that she sang,Died tired of this living thing,Most I knew never made it to drinking age,Sometimes I fight Gipp,Should I spend or should I hold on for what tomorrow brings,Fly ain't that roll egg, so many lips in my head,Seeing some act up from one taste out the cup,Can't build me up to cut me down,Gipp is in your game, but Gipp won't play your game,In the day after,I been this way since birth,Heaven upon sent a newborn to tell it like he see it,No lies thru the eyes of an angel suggest you don't table,Every angle be obtuse, it's no truce, it's war,It won't stop, to compromise wouldn't stop the bloodsheddin',It's Armageddon in the streets of each inner city,Ain't takin' no pity on this unjust callin' it trust,I'm on the bus starin' out of a window,Thankin' 'bout them happy days I had,Over the summer growin' up fast to face life and harsh realities,That come wit the territory didn't know when I was young,So many get hung to hang,Take away the bad and bring back,The good that die mostly over bullshit,Takin' a gun and pulled it on an innocent friend of mine,That could have been yours,How can I stop the war and all the crime,Inside the minds that's programmed to destroy,From the beginning when will it end,On the day after judgement will I be ready,I'm so happy we made it,I knew one day we would,All these years of strugglin',Were never understood,Now my eyes are open,And I can clearly see,We didn't die for nothin','Cause we are finally free,I'm so happy,Meant I'd be spoiled rotten,A fin here a fin there but receipts please,For my feet I need, a new pair of hi rollin',But the car ain't stolen,Pistol still smokin' from herndon homin' in on somebody,Gotta pay for restitution with heavily on my mind,Free fom mental debris hose me down,There my physical frame lay returnin' to its rightful place,A quest for forgiveness answer...,The death toll talley but my soul was spared,How is your prepared medium rare if you dare disobey,Well done race you the last one to orion star,Smellin' like shit in the glass jar,The bomb light years away from earth secure a space for my family,The mother of my first conceived and all the weak relatives,I hurt only, when I laugh,On display afta judge none careless atmosphere,Opportunity knockin' answer it knewin you would,Good thangs come to those that wait,Took a los on church strait,The nifty fifth whut better place,For more enenmy to hide than behind religion,Done gee seen on I pray for you but I won't follow you to your end,I know of a place not too far away,That maybe you and I can both go someday,But I gotta make sure cause I ain't tryin' to stay here,Don't y'all realize that the end is so near,But don't have fear 'cause you still got time,I hope you wanna come when I'm done with the rhyme,Let me explain so you won't claim you didn't know,And you can make sure that this is where you wanna go,It's all about preparing yourself for the return,And a trip to your soul is the only way you'll learn,But if you choose not to go that ain't my concern,I guess in hell you'll just have to burn,The devil will tell lies and try to trick yo soul to receive it,They tell you that my Lord ain't coming' back and you believe it,Regardless if you listen to me,In the end we'll see,I'm so happy we made it,I knew one day we would,All these years of strugglin',Were never understood,Now my eyes are open,And I can clearly see,We didn't die for nothin','Cause we are finally free,I'm so happy
