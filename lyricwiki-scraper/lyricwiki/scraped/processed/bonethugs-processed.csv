everything happin' for a reason,Can you tell me why these niggas bleedin',Needin' general assistance,I'm here needin' public housing,I'm here tryna make ends meet,Tryna get on their feet,But see my brain so cloudy,And I know what you don't know,You better get on your mission and get down for your dough,See the real niggas ready out here taken control,See I'm screamin' out Mo',With my pockets on swoll,Please Mr. Postman, quit bringin' these bills to my house,Quit bringin' this stress to my spouse,Cause I'm ready for the kill on look out, look out,If you niggas try to run up on the Bone,I'ma

clocked on the night-shift,Didn't think I'd ever make it out, out, out of the ghetto,But we finally made it,Stay dedicated to the music we made yeah,Now it's on Bone Thug,Leave alone, came back the

wrong,Since you left Bone, it never been right,I knew it woulda been on,We woulda been tight,We woulda been in the zone ridin' so high,Up in the game fire, does, lie,See we used to love makin' music,We was always in the studio, groovin',We kept it movin', we was ready to do it ,But you know I'm goin' through it,And ain't feelin this rap thing right now,They got me trippin' ready to

brave,Not one of the slaves, and one of the paid,,And I'll be one of the saved, stay hatin' the fake,On the television runnin' 'round tellin' niggas be ready for hate,,Guard Leathaface and the grin right up under my face,I steady debate the pain that I bring with hate,Sweet as the cake, I take another puff and shake,And swallow my pride it's all about heartache, hard to break,Lost mommy, poppy left home,I miss Wish' Uncle Charlie,Sit listenin in the back and tellin his selection,His date is probably,,Probably my mommy,song,,Cryin for the life of you gone,,Just me and my destiny let's roll, let's roll,-Chorus-,-Wish Bone-,When I lost my Uncle Charles a part of me went wrong,And it happened when the Bone was comin' up so strong,We just wanted him to see what we do,You motivated us at the shows we see too,And I really hope you live through what we spit on the song,You might have been through somethin' hope its nothing like Bone,Like one said we'll never make it,Like two, thirty mil in they faces,And I really gone slow when Bone has already left,Crossed over, back to the hood we souljahs,The music nigga make it back, scandlous,But faith kicked in and the world shows and we winnin'

NO DATE Bone Thugs-N-Harmony:Fuck Tha Police,Bone Thugs-N-Harmony,"Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!,Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!,Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!,Fuck the police!!!,,Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground,A young nigga get it bad cause I'm brown,And not the other color so police think,They have the authority to kill a minority,But muthafucka makin' as I ain't the one,For a punk muthafucka with a badge and a gun,To be beaten on, and then I'm thrown in jail,But we can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell,Fuckin' with a nigga cause a nigga turned rager,And got a little bit of money and a pager,Search a nigger's car, lookin' for product,Thinkin' every thug nigga's sellin' narcotics,You'd rather see, me in the pen,Than me blowin' endo, rollin' in my Benz-o,I send the police to the grave,And when I'm finished,Make 'em bring the yellow tape,To tape off the scene of the slaughter,Still gettin' swoll off bread and water,I don't know if they're fags or what,Search a nigga down, and grab on his nuts,And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none,But don't let it be a black and a white one,Cause they'll slam you down to the street top,Black police showin' out for the white cop,But Krayzie Bone will swarm,On any muthafucka in a blue uniform,Just cause I'm from, the C-L-E,Them punk muthafuckas be afraid of me,Uh, a young nigga on the warpath,And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath,Of cops, dyin' around my way,Yo bitch I got somethin to say,,Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!,Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!,Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!,Fuck the police!!!,,Fuck the police and Bone said it with authority,Because the niggas on the street is a majority,A gang, and is whenever I'm steppin',That a muthafuckin' weapon is kept in,A stash spot, for the so-called law,Wishin' Bone was a nigga that they never saw,Lights start flashin' behind me,But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me,But that shit don't work, I just laugh,And plus it gives 'em a hint, not to step in my path,The police, I'm sayin': ""Fuck you punk!"",Readin' my rights and shit - it's all junk,Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand,With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand,But take off the gun so we can see what's up,And I go at it punk and I'ma fuck you up,Make you think I'ma kick your ass,But drop your gat, and Bone's gon' blast,I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime,And I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time,Smoke any muthafucka that sweats me,And any asshole, that threats me,I'm a sniper with a helluva scope,Takin' out a cop or two, they can't fuck with me,The muthafuckin' killer that's mad,With potential, to get bad as fuck,Now I'ma turn it around,Dig in the clip, yo, and this is the sound,BOOM BOOM - yeah, somethin' like that,But it all depends on the size of the strap,Takin' out a police, will make my day,And a nigga like Bone don't give a fuck to say,,Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!,Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!,Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!,Fuck the police!!!,,I'm tired of these muthafuckin' jackets,Sweatin' my thug while we be thuggin' in the shack and,Shinin' them lights in my face and for what?,Maybe it's because I'm kickin' so much butt,I kick ass nigga or maybe cause I blast,On a stupid-ass nigga when I'm playin' with the trigger,Of an Uzi or an A.K.,Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say,They put out my picture with silence,Cause my identity along with my group causes violence,It's the Bone with the criminal behavior,Yeah, I'm a thugster nigga,But still I got flavor,Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?,A nigga in a uniform waitin' to get shot by me,Or one of my niggas,And with a gat it don't matter if you're smaller or bigger,,And as you all know Layzie Bone came to rule,Whenever I'm rollin' keep 'em lookin' in your mirror,And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a,Dumb muthafucka with a gun,And when I'm rollin' up the 8, you'll be the one,That I take out, and then I get away,And while I'm drivin' off laughin' this is what I'll say,Believe that,,Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!,Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!,Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!,Fuck the police!!!,

NO DATE Bone Thugs-N-Harmony:Determination,Bone Thugs-N-Harmony,", I mean yeah, it's all up to you. You gotta be determined to bring this vision into your life bro'! If God has put something on your heart, it's up to you to take the faith and bring this thing into reality.  I mean you gotta be determined by all means necessary! You gotta bring the unseen to the scene. You know what I mean? ,,You need the basic information before you can leave Earth in the B-I-B-L-E is the source of the true word. Some choices they do hurt, faith was there without work. From the minute you was birth, you only find out when you search. I'm preparin' for the worst but strive for the best, it's survival of the fittest. I'm alive so I'm blessed. With eyes bearing witness while I'm prayin' for forgiveness. I'ma give it all I got from the start to the finish! ,,Oooh, every day we pray,  yes we pray!  Oooh, every day we pray,  yes we pray!  You must need determination, determination. Don't let distractions replace it - you can make it! You must be strong and be patient!  'Cause it must be determination, determination.,,I'm tryin' to make it to the finish line,  but I'm cursed in the worst way, Satan was a friend of mine.  'Til I woke up and I realized  association with the fakers and haters I had to minimize. have ya seen the bad side of a Gemini? it isnt really that vibe between him and I. Nigga die, bye, 'til I rise to the occasion. Determined that I make it, no matte what I'm facin'!,,,We all poor with God giving purpose and that's served! and everybody got work to put in for The Lord. See we nutin but servants  whos goal is to move forward Gotta be strong and determined to march forward. Every night I just simpley go backwards. swear that i refuse to lose, man that's a fact. Life is like a war and you prolly loose a few battles if you let them, they'll send you up a creek without a paddel. ,,If you dream it you can reach it fast. Determination is a hustle wit a good plan, understand? Set some goals, grab a hold, on your toes, cos rest only comes to the dead and goneand a nigga leaves everytime the sun comes up, life is full of deeds and the trials but you can run with them, defently its coine its a phase you cant run from, listen to the wise you might make it past stage one, ignoriate, dont ever step out in the cold ,,,Once in your heart then there's nothing can stand in your way...  determination! ,,Determination we pray,  and in the rhythem we lay,  give me the strength,  cupid ,,,

Who want it? How could it be mine and I'm still ,hungry still homely, lost and lonely? So I holler at the forces of the wind as ,a friend! But I predicted this ending back in the day, cuz I had visions of bad ,decisions, knew niggas would go astray. Although we pray and we pray and we ,pray, we do, but see when a nigga lose faith, no more united, divided we fall ,nigga, then haul. We all dealt fucked up cards, but don't complain just play ,the hand that you was dealt. You play them right you prevail, you play them ,wrong then you fail. It ain't hard to tell, when you be headed for ,self-destruction. Cuz I could look at a piece of the puzzle. It ain't no love ,involved. Everything we was dissolved. We all hard as one but together we raw. ,And it ain't a nigga that can fuck with that. We spreaded the talent my nigga, ,what's up with that? Letting the devil get in. Should've pinned. You was ,pretendin' to be friends. We was slickin by the snake in the grass, slither ,slicked a nigga fast. Yeah, the,mothafuckin snake in the grass. We dropped our guards and it got inside us ,like a virus. Now our family reunion done turned into a family crisis, crisis,,There's always something you got to give up,If you want everything you want,I was never on some solo shit. Always down to roll and blow a head off. He jet ,off ,and don't know me, don't tell me you love me. When I was lonely and my daddy ,died, all of my niggas came. Nigga dreamt, and thanks for coming, I'm still ,stressed out over the death. And I take my breath to puff my cigarrete . I ,think the world is just collapsing, but I'm still rapping. Get it all of my ,chest, go wacking back to the action. When the bird was flying low, and ,laughing, family bashing till it just happened and Wally passed in the ashes. ,Working it tragic, gloomy, asking if you'll ever come back tomorrow. We tellin ,the truth clone, you still beating around the bush. Baby I'm sorry. It's all in ,the game. Throwing up blood . Fuck it Lay, let's sign our life away!,,You see me,I ain't givin up a motherfuckin thang,It's hard to come by, and I ain't no bitch nigga. Shit, committ some robberies ,and walk-by's. But you don't want that. Neither do I, but I will I will cuz I'm ,a hustler, hustler. High till I die. I'ma get mine even if it means murder, ,fuck it let me fire. Cuz a nigga thirsty nowadays. But I'm a hustler just like ,you, don't bring that shit my way.,,Well if it's something you can't give up ,To get everything you want ,Hell naw, I be thugged out nigga, turned out nigga.

NO DATE Bone Thugs-N-Harmony:Creepin On Ah Come Up,Bone Thugs-N-Harmony,"Devilish Eazy-E Voice,Right about now, Thugs~N~Harmony is on a come up, so to all you bustas out there, beware.,Bizzy,Stalkin' gat fools, walkin' jack moves. ,Krayzie,Woke up this morning with the thought of robbin' a bank to get rich. Ain't ate in days so it ain't no thang to click click, bitch, gimme your shit. Fresh out the pen, and I'm low on ends, fuck calm, I tried to stay thug. Got flowin' skills, but nigga, they bitches, now I just can't buy my bud. With my steel, grabbed the 44 Mag' plus a sack, and I snag my leather rag. Can't reveal when I glide with the moneybag, ride to the hide', count my flags. I be livin' on the darkside, and I can't escape, some say it's a phase. If it is, only way I'm gonna survive is if I play with my gauge. It's a raid. Put your face to pave. If you try to play brave, you'll get slayed. Pull down them shades, empty your pockets, watches, jewels, and you'll be safe. I snatched the clerk up by her neck, put the gun in her mouth and said, ""Bitch, you better move quick back to the safe, if you wanna be killed try some stupid shit."" ""And pushin' that panic switch will get you nowhere but hell."" Trail to the back with the money in the sack, l,ocked 'em all in the vault, time to bail. Well, tickets I'm out the door, hopped in the smug, and I break fast. Get to my pad, sit back and laugh, loc'd out as I flip through my cash. At last, nigga made good, and I got away smooth. Now, I'm straight. Covered my tracks, only description is that nigga with that leather face, fool. I gotta get mine, and if you stall, then I'm gunnin'. Just work your job, get paid. I'll rob ya. See, a nigga creep on ah come up.,Bizzy,Stalkin' gat fools, walkin' jack moves. ,Layzie,See, I'm sittin' in my room, and a nigga feelin' down, steady thinkin' about how to get paid. Gotta gauge at my waist that be spellin' out murder that'll get a nigga locked the cage. Lay my head to bed, start to thinkin' hard, money is the cause. What can I do me for? Need to hit a lick, not a bullshit, but a real lick, like robbin' a jewelry store. Select which one will I raid. Got be headin' downtown, 'cause tonight's the night. Dressed in my black, wearin' makeup on my face so a nigga can't be seen in the spotlight. Stole two cars, and I parked one north, parked one east for the smooth switch. When a nigga bail, how the fuck he gonna tell if a nigga don't dwell in the same shit? Climb to the roof, and I'm peepin' out the scene, and there's no one I can spot. So I get my ass down, walked around to the window, and I broke the bitch out with a rock. Now I jump my ass in. Start to fillin' up the bag, and a nigga comin' up on these diamonds. Grabbed a couple herring bones, and some rings, and some ropes, still ,thinkin' how them diamonds was shining. Went to the cash register, broke the bitch open, grabbed all the money they had. And a nigga gettin' goin' gone to Bone, yeah, got to let my niggas check out my bag. And I got away smooth, 'cause I had the shit planned, and ain't no bullshit get brung up. That's what I gotta do if I wanna get paid, 'cause a nigga be creepin' on ah come up.,Bizzy,Stalkin' gat fools, walkin' jack moves. ,Downin' Jamacian spliffs, little nigga Ripsta on this lick and bang bang. Nigga that's the clique on my brain. Yet another victim, insane. Feel the murderous nerve—this twelve shot pump, and I gotta bigger gat to back me. Peelin' in my smug, thug, hoody, black skully, black khakis. Creepin' in my smug, so reapin', peek into the window, let me cock this. Nigga must've been meant to be jacked, 'cause here comes me hostage. Up outta the door, with a pump to her temple, should've seen her tremble. Push any alarms, and I drop them bombs on moms. It's just that simple. I took my ganjas and fried 'em. Don't gimme no hassle, bitch! 'Cause I've been scopin' for weeks, and I know y'all got some shit. Clack back me gun, hollow point mixed with dum-dum kickin'. Ladies and babies scream onto the floor. ""Shut up and listen!"" It's a jack move, fools. Give me the jewels, the dope, the weed, the cheese, and answer me why and you hoes is cryin', 'cause bitches are dyin'? ""Blood'n clot, get up! You dead!"": What one of them ni,ggas said. Buckshot up into them dreads, and I love when I hear them pump red. One that callin' me bluff, I stuffed him with the quickness. See, made out with a smooth thirty G's. So all bodies must bleed, I need no witness. So with-a-me slug, Mo Thug jumped into him smug. Rolled the blunt up, good stuff reefer, hitted the Bone to give up love to me thugs. 'Cause I done made it clean as fuck, and I flees the scene with a buck buck, 'cause a nigga be creepin' on ah come up.,Stalkin' gat fools, walkin' jack moves.

But so did my nigga, my nigga--he's gone, and all he left was his memories. But when I die, you gon' see me. One, two, three, Wally rest in peace, please.,,Can a nigga tell me why so many my niggas had to die, so much pain. Even niggas in the hood is no good, put one to your own homie's brain. And a nigga gettin' high, thinkin' back, in the days when we did some fucked-up thangs. Now, I gotta ask God if that's the reason my homie's gone away. And I gotta give hate to ya gangstas out there fakin' the funk, actin' like you got a problem, but your just too goddamned drunk.
