2000,Bow Wow,"Yeah,I'm the hottest thing to hit the block,Since the CL5,From CO to ATL I keeps it locked,Like a fresh pair of 23's, once seen,Can't get enough of me, my team,Getting paper from all angles,Which means everybody got a triangle,Ya heard me?,I'm the truth like beans,And when it comes to teens in this rap thing,You looking at the mob,Not to mention that I'm hot,Yeah you already know,And I shuts down the block everywhere that I go,Call me the Tiger Woods of this,Yeah Im gettin explosive,I come with the dopest flow at 13 like whoa,1 - Little girls think that I'm deliscious,Grown folks say I'm just too viscious,But they don't understand,It's just the dog in me,And that's just the way I am,Mess with me you get bit,In 2k I ain't having it,What y'all don't understand?,It's just the dog in me,And that's just the way I am,Lil man with the big checks,Lil man thats got big girls,Wanting to teach me about sex

2000,Bow Wow,"f/ Jagged Edge & JD,,,Je y'all,,Yo I'm looking for girls,,Girls that can give me puppy love,Ya know?,,Yeah it's going down right here,West coast rock on,,East coast rock on,,Dirty South rock on,Yeah,,All young girls beware,This pup's off the chains,I'm gritty little something here,Putting down pain,Since I was six,Running with the pound,It's been going down,I'm city to city, town to town,They running up screaming my name,Running up grabbing my chain,Running up tryna get in the game,I'm like ma don't get it twisted,If we kick it get your bark on,Hope to God you see me again, when I'm grown,Type of playa but it ain't,It just sounds like that,Cause I'm just too young to get down like that,,Hit the movies, hit the mall,Then come out with big bags,Next day do lunch then head Six Flags,But it don't mean nothing,We're just having some fun,Even though I may have told you on the ride,You're the on,I'm sorry little shorty,I just gotta take that back,Cause I'm just too young to get down like that,So...,,,Not a word that I be saying,
