NO DATE Will Smith:Parents Just Don't Understand (W/ Dj Jazzy Jeff),Will Smith,"You know parents are the same,No matter time nor place,They don't understand that us kids,Are going to make some mistakes,So to you, all the kids all across the land,There's no need to argue,Parents just don't understand,I remember one year,My mom took me school shopping,It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister,All hopped in the car,We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall,My mom started bugging with the clothes she chose,I didn't say nothing at first,I just turned up my nose,She said, ""What's wrong? This shirt cost $20"",I said, ""Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!"",The next half hour was the same old thing,My mother buying me clothes from 1963,And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate,I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!,I said, ""Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep"",She said, ""You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet"",I said, ""Mom, let's put these clothes back, please"",She said ""no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show"",I said, ""This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer,Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers,But if you don't want to I can live with that but,You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks"",She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same,Inevitably the first day of school came,I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick,But my mom said, ""No, no way, uh-uh, forget it"",There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax,I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts,And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought,The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought,And those who weren't laughing still had a ball,Because they were pointing and whispering,As I walked down the hall,I got home and told my Mom how my day went,She said, ""If they were laughing you don't need the,,""Cause they're not good friends"",For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom,That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times,So to you all the kids all across the land,There's no need to argue,Parents just don't understand,Oh-kay, here's the situation,My parents went away on a week's vacation and,They left the keys to the brand new Porsche,Would they mind?,Umm, well, of course not,I'll just take it for a little spin,And maybe show it off to a couple of friends,I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood,Well, maybe I shouldn't,Yeah, of course I should,Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot,I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block,That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking,I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking,You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions,I honked my horn just to get her attention,She said, ""Was that for me?"",I said, ""Yeah"",She said, ""Why?"",I said, ""Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy"",She said, ""How do I know you're not sick?,You could be some deranged lunatic"",I said, ""C'mon toots - my name is the Prince =,Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?"",She agreed and we were on our way,She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word,We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive,We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes,She kicked her shoes off onto the floor,She said, ""Drive fast, speed turns me on"",She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas,We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast,The sun roof was open , the music was high,And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh,She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far,I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car,We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche,And to make this long story short - short,When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell,I said, ""I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer"",I almost had a heart attack that day,Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway,I was arrested, the car was impounded,There was no way for me to avoid being grounded,My parents had to come off from vacation to get me,I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me,My parents walked in,I got my grip, I said, ""Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?"",They didn't speak,I said, ""I want to plead my case"",But my father just shoved me in the car by my face,That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived,They took turns -,One would beat me while the other one was driving,I can't believe it, I just made a mistake,Well parents are the same no matter time nor place,So to you all the kids all across the land,Take it from me,Parents just don't understand

1993,Will Smith,"Shadow dreams,Dreams of a shadow,The analogy of a shadow dream,Dreams are to shadows as your shadows are to your dreams,In the deepest of the darkness it seams as though they're gone,In the light they are visible,Yet intangible and illusive,Your shadow is the true validation of the fact that you exist,Hence shadow dreams,And here we go,Shadow dreams they seem so distant,But the light is strong and no you can't resist it,Keep on pushing, hold out your hand,But light is your friend go on In ?carrolan?,Its always darkest before the light,Nothing's worth having if its not worth a fight,No love without labor, no labor no love,Draw on the strength bestowed from above,What can go wrong will go wrong,But if you fall of a horse just get back on,""I have a dream"" the man stated,A shadow dream that he chased to his grave,Just because a dream is lurking in the shadows doesn't mean that you should just forget it,I mean you work and you push and you sweat and you toil and you strive and drive till you get it shadow dreams,Shadow Dreams,Dreams of a shadow ,Shadow Dreams,Dreams of a shadow,Every dark cloud is hiding a silver lining,But don't forget to mobilise, keep on climbing,Do all you can to keep your shadow alive,Because your not far behind if your shadow dies,Make sure you stop and you check tonight,That your shadow is behind you when you walk through the light,Cause a man without a shadow ain't a man at all,I mean I take it just for granted that my homies on the wall,Kids see the shadows and they wanna play,But sometimes their stolen, taken away,Adults are the thieves, the kids get robbed,Throw away that shadow boy go and get a job,Just because the dream is lurking in the shadows doesn't mean that you should forget it,I mean you work and you push and you sweat and you toil and you strive and drive till you get it shadow dreams,Shadow Dreams,Dreams of a shadow ,Shadow Dreams,Dreams of a shadow,Fourteen years old I used to want a beamer,I guess you could say I was what you'd call a shadow dreamer,I told my father that I didn't think I'd ever get in,I said I might as well just forget it,My father said son, don't be talking so dumb,Hard work and education makes anything come,And plus a shadow dream ain't as far as ya seem son,You used to be a shadow dream,Life is a mystery but lets check history,To see how many peoples shadow dreams came true,And if the other peoples shadow dreams are equal then why cant the next shadow dreamer be you,That's the philosophy I live my life by,When things get hard through the stress and strife I,Keep on pushing with a full head of steam,Like a train through the tunnel to my shadow dream,Shadow Dreams,Dreams of a shadow ,Shadow Dreams,Dreams of a shadow,Shadow Dreams,Dreams of a shadow ,Shadow Dreams,Dreams of a shadow ,Uh ha,Shadow Dreams,Dreams of a shadow'

1991,Will Smith,",You're trapped on the dance floor,It's locked there's no escape,There's no eat no drink cant take a break,No seat to sit down you gotta stand up,The record on the wheel reacts like a handcuff,You're in a cage and this groove will bound you,People in the club like bars around you,The doors open up and the people are poured in,You're are the prisoners the DJ is the warden,Your mind is useless instinct takes control,Jam the techno ,Groove to soul to soul,You been arrested ,Now your being tested,The beat is a sex fiend, you're being molested,Snare drum kicks like pistol in spinal,You gotta dance and get rammed like a Rhino,The DJ cuts with a knife like a surgery,Sayin that the slice aint nice that's purgory,The music infiltrates you takes you,Grabs you holds you moulds you makes you,Do things you wouldn't have otherwise done,Like shake rattle roll pump twist and then some,Ain't no law here you can't protest this ,Stop looking around there ain't no exits,You can't leave till the man pulls the needle,Take that as a warning,Take heed or I'll quicken the pitch and make you dance faster ,The drum is the whip, bass line is the master,The temperature's a 100 and yet you still want more,You're a slave and your trapped on the dance floor,,Oh oh I'm trapped like a ???puma in a cage???,I can't get out,Can't you see I'm trapped,Can't you see I'm so confused,I can't get out,Now your wondering lost in a jungle,You came in hyped up but now your humble,Bringing out sweat in your soakin' wet clothes,You scream for help, blend in with the ???""ows"" and ""ohs""???,You try to sit but their ain't know spaces,The floor is a desert, the party - oasis,I know your on the tip for the rhyme I just did,And here's a little taste of my homeboy, El Sid,,Ay a Prince it's the El Sid's version,I'm a raid on the track, I'm a hip-hop surgeon,The floor is jam packed get away from the bar scene,The strum of the drum has you trapped like a sardine,You try to move no form of escape,The heat brings on sweat, stick on like tape,Party's like a ???,Girls slim and trim on the floor,Don't try to shoot for the door,This ain't the gym,The party goers every night had a scene,This mic try to respond but still trapped like in Venus,Aint a spiff or a spoof,Boy you better not goof,You about to cave in although you ain't on a roof,The rhythm track from all sides and angles,Playing ???wind-pipe??? resist - strange,You can't escape until the DJ's thing is up,So play like a phone or coat and just hang it up,The speakers pumping out sounds and hip words ,Lines between the rhythm designed to equip nerds,You better jam we don't care if you hardcore,Cause we got you trapped on the dance floor,,Me and Prince got together just to kick out lines,No trouble at the party cause we're strapped with nines,Dance floor secure, don't bother tryin to get out,You looking for the late AM this man wont let out,Nobody cause killing is mean,Got ya dancin' in the dark and dressed like Springsteen,Razzamatazz and pasazz about to rip the flesh is my man Jazz Fresh,,Soon as I worked through the door,I got trapped on the dance floor,See this girlie that I never saw,She was looking raw,Came a little closer,Then I approached her,Then I drop the fox trot so hot that I roast her,Burnt ???Going down in flames??? it's damn shame,hard to explain,I did it up like I was straight outta Soul Train,Listen as I discuss this yo bust this,Like Hammer before me you cant touch this,Trapped on the floor like a vulture,Part of my culture,You may even thought I was drived to faulter,Get live like the Jackson 5 Tito and Jermaine,Add a little Mike and Janet you can't understand it,Cause ???Hammer and Mike??? thought I was from another planet,Way of whipping and dipping,And slidin' ???and glidin'??? of what I'm providin,Other dancers go and hidin',Like Charles Manson I'm prancin,I keep the dance all night until,The party's over the party's over,Like a cowboy at a rodeo ,From mister make you dosie doe,Around the dance floor,Steppin the new hardcore,I'm Jazz Fresh and I'm trapped,,Max up to step up,just to keep this rap up,the talent he possesses the best ain't a contest,Jeff with his right and left like Jazz Fresh,No other than the brother the lover Jazzy Jeff,,I'm the warden the dance floor is the state pen,start serving your time around quarter to ten,time's served hard the customer's scarred,your tickets to freedom,yo you ain't gonna need em,your sentence is 25 years to life,a bed and a pillow is your husband and wife,trapped behind the steel,the steel of the wheels,don't come to the party if you don't wanna know how prison feels,I walk strong carry a big stick,Cell by cell all packed in thick,When they sound the drum you know its time to roll,Might as well have fun there's no parole,I set a trap and caught you like a mouse,Rough times ahead no chance for a halfway house,Pump the bass in all sections,Prince, Sid, and Jazz my officers of correction,Cant' escape the floor cut the crime out,Thirty foot wall ain't no use tryin to climb out,cause I'm running this show and it's live in here,you try to escape another five years,I got you trapped and I'm your savior,You dance real hard you might get out on good behavior,But if you don't I give you more,'Cause DJ Jazzy Jeff got you trapped on the dance floor,

1991,Will Smith,"This is a story I'll never forget,About the day my new car got hit,It could me off guard cause it happened so quick,When I heard the crash I got mad as hell,Cruising down the highway fast not slow,Ninety miles an hour in my five point o,People waving at me cause they know who I am,Alpine stereo blasting a jam,Put the top down said my girlfriend,Then my damn hat blew off in the wind,I got kind of mad cause it's the hat I just bought,I should of put her out it was all her fault,Day was Friday date was the tenth,My girl was looking good on her strength,She smacked my hand when I put it on her knee,I said hit me again and I'll break your wrist,That day I dressed all in white,Taking my girl to Palm Springs for the night,I was hoping I could find a short cut,I was tired plus I had a rash on my butt,There was this lady in a pinto croup,About ninety years old I could tell by the droop,Driving all fast border line insane,Glasses so thick couldn't stay in her lane,I swerved left and I swerved right,But she was still tale gating me too damn tight,To the left lane I tried to switch then,You saw my blinker bitch,We both pulled off on the side of the road,I was hot ready to explode,The only thing stopping me from breaking her nose,Was I was 21 and she was ninety years old,Then the police came turned the lights off,The lady started crying and the cop got soft,The cop said oh it'll be okay,Wrinkled old bag looking like a sharpe,I said wait what's going on cap,Her cars fine my cars all wrecked,Then I saw what happened in the crash,Her dentures came out got stuck in the dash,You hit me I didn't hit you,Stop holding your neck lady you can't sue,It's your fault you caused all this,You saw my blinker bitch,Wednesday, October the fourth,That's when we got our day in court,That lady destroyed my case ,When she came in a wheelchair and a neck brace,I jumped up I said you must be joking,Come on judge her neck ain't broken,Well I'll be damned,Wrinkled old bag started crying on the stand,The bailiff grabbed me slammed me on the ground,Judge said boy you better come down,Aren't you one of them damn rap singers,Yeah, then I gave him the finger,Judge held me contempt of court,For giving him the finger and things of that sort,Anything to say before you're dismissed,Just one you saw my blinker bitch

1988,Will Smith,"For years I have been waiting and hesitating to make a rap record,That had the pace of a slow song, quiet storm, chillin while the fire is warm,You and your girl, with this record on your radio or stereo, I don't know,I love you so is what you'll be sayin, while this record's playin,You reminiscing and kissin your girl,Relax, lay back, unwind, cause now is time to chill,Setting the mood, by the use of this groove,Is an ingenious, perceptive, brilliant, a very clever move,Because the bassline, combined with the fresh rhyme at a slow tempo enticed passion to grow,But if it's not passion, for which you search then use the song as a massage after a hard day's work,And if it's true that music calms the savage beast,Play this cut in the jungle and put the lions to sleep,Take a deep breath, stretch, kick off your footwear,Put on the tape of this record, but beware,Caution, warning, it's your decision,There's nothin stronger that you can buy, without prescription,It's soothing, somewhat hypnotic,A rhythmic anaesthetic it's practically a narcotic,You want it we got it come get it we're widdit,Because it's all at the push of a button yo Jeff hit it,The objective of this musical extravaganza is to enlighten you stanza by stanza,Verse after verse have been precisely arranged,Rearranged and then changed until the best remained,The result being this incredible song,So for at least eight hours a day you'll have this record on,In the morning and at night in your room,And it's all through the afternoon you will be listening mentally rapped up in the cut,Some people will sit down and some will choose to get up,But whatever you choose just keep your ear to the wax,Because we got something def that other rappers lack,We haven't been able to put our fingers on what it is,But it's different and it's def and it appeals to kids and teens and adults and senior citizens too,And I'd be willing to bet that it appeals to you, too,So if you're not into rap give us a chance to change your mind and to make you dance,To this lyrical miracle this musical discovery,But yo I wanna chill for a second yo Jeff, cover me,It's like paradise, this music is nice,It makes you hot if you want it too, or twice as cold as ice,It brings love to the heart of a criminal,With this subliminal power, all the women'll flock while all the guys rocks, when it's on your box,It gained us a much bigger reputation than the White Sox,You may ask yourself are we that famous,Bust this, the Queen of Spain knows what my real name is,Our time is runnin short so I'll bid you farewell,You know this cut is so def that you have been overwhelmed,Be cool, be chill relax have no fear,I'm outta here

1989,Will Smith,",I was cruisin down the avenue early one Friday,When I saw what I thought was a lady walkin my way,I turned my back to mama can I blast,And I said hmm excuse me and she walked past,She was about five foot six or maybe six and a half,With a body like a goddess, man, this girl was bad!,Tight leather pants that fit like a drum,And two big - yeah well, she had some,Anyway from behind she was fine,But when she turned around, her mustache was bigger than mine,At first I laughed, cause yo, to me that was funny,But the laughter ceased when she said hey honey,At first I was confused, I was somewhat spell-bound,My mouth wide open and my chin on the ground,And then it hit me, like a bolt from the sky,I thought: hold up - wait - this girl is a guy,I tried to get away, I said, Well, never mind,Maybe I'll see you some other time,But then he grabbed me by my arm and told me I couldn't leave,And said, Hey boy, you look mighty cute in them jeans,This had to be the most embarrassing thing in the world,My whole neighbourhood was watching me get beat up by a girl,And when my homeboys came, they didn't let me explain,They said prince, you're a sucker, you should be ashamed,My pride was busted right along with my eye,Cause my homeboys didn't realize that this girl was a guy,And in retrospect I had to laugh,I can't believe I didn't notice that this girlie had a mustache,,I remember last year, the day was October 5th,And my family went away on a weekend ski trip,And they left $100 and a note by the phone,That said don't have any company till we get home,No company I'm 18 They must be jokin!,And by 10 my crib was smokin,All of my friends with their hands in the air,Screaming ,The party was jammin till at least about 5,And as my friends were leaving, they were like Homes, it was live,I thought the party was over, but really was just beginning,I turned around I thought I was dreamin, I saw four women,Dressed in red leather, tight to their booties,I gestured with my index finger come here, cuties,I tried to be chill, I didn't wanna scare em,I said Hi my name's the Prince they said Hi Prince, wheres your harem,I didn't waste time, I started shooting the gift,I said Y'all the type of girls I'd like to spend some time with,I walked upstair, my adrenaline pumpin,Till one hit me in the head with a lamp or somethin,The next thing I remember is wakin up nearly dead,With another Fred Flintstone lump on my head,Of course I was mad, this type of thing can burn at you,They tied me up and they were stealin my furniture,I said Yo sweetheart, what's wrong with you,What kind of stuff is this for a nice girl like you to do?"",She turned around and smiled and laughed,And that's the way that I noticed that the girlie had a mustache,Not four girls, four guys,They were in disguise it was a set up all the time,I made a complete fool of myself that day,My parents were pullin up just as the u-haul truck was pullin away,They walked in, looked like they seen a ghost,There I was, gagged and bound and tied to the bed post,My pop walked in and asked a brilliant question,Son, where's the furniture and why is your room so messy,Obviously Sherlock Holmes had been arrived,I said What do you think, dad, maybe we were robbed,I'm tied up, nothing's in one piece,Let's discuss the facts later, mom, please call the police,I wanted to have a party, I thought I was clever,My pop told me I was on punishment forever!,And in retrospect I had to laugh,I can't believe I didn't notice that the girlie had a mustache,

1987,Will Smith,",Now I'm the Fresh Prince, and if you got good sense,You'll keep your distance, because my sole intent,Is to rock and shock the spot and give my all, which is a lot,And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm takin it to the top,,A whole lot of people rap, but what good is that,If the rap that they're rappin is way off track?,I don't mean to attack you, but I'm cuttin no slack,To those people that I hear saying meaningless raps,In actuality, I mean in reality,The words that you use are a mere formality,Vocabulary is not what it's about,The point that you're tryin to get across is what counts,Cause when a lot of rappers rap, they try to use big words,But that's the most absurd thing I've ever heard of,They think that that's impressive, but when will they learn their lesson,That it's not the words that count, it's the message,They get a lot of big words out of some magazine,And nine times out of ten they don't even know what they mean,They stand up on the stage, huffin and puffin,Rappin for nearly an hour, but they're not sayin nothin,Really but a lot of jibberish,And I know that they all wish,They had access to fresh rhymes like this,I came to rock and shock and give my all, which is a lot,And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm takin it to the top,,Fresh rhymes and a razzamatazz,Smooth power and grace and mucho pizzazz,Good looks and charm and personality,You punch it in your calculator, and it adds up to me,I know the same goes for the rest of my crew,My deejay Jazzy Jeff and Ready Rock C too,The ultimate combination of strenght and prestige,My crew holds the key to fun and everything you need,To party all night, yes, it's you we will excite,The time is right, so don't fight it,Suckers, please don't bite it,We came to rock and shock and give our all, which is a lot,And no, we're not about to stop because we're takin it to the top,,I really hate to brag about him,But when people doubt him,I have to stand up and tell the whole world all about him,'United we stand, divided we fall',Is the moto of our crew and it's honored by all,Of us, we pledge allegiance to the work we rehearse,And it enables us always to come out first,We came to rock and shock and give our all, which is a lot,Yo Jeff, man, why don't you take it to the top?,,We succeed everytime we attempt,To rock the house, you've got to dance cause no one is exempt,From the rules set forth by us, of course you know,Stay out our way or behold the brute force of,Me Jeff and Ready Rock C,We're a trio, oh, you didn't know? That means,That there's three of us, one for all and all for one,And we're takin it to the top before we get done,I'm inclined to rhyme, anytime you'll find,It ain't a rapper with a mind as impressive as mine,I insist on a rise and I despise a decline,On the day I descend, that's the day I resign,I'm creatin my trends and innovatin my rap,Why is that? I don't know, I guess I got it like that!,My personality extends beyond the realm of mediocre,My advice for life is, if you want somethin, go for it,Cause there's nothin that's beyond your grasp,Just set your mind to it, work hard, and you can have,Anything that you want, the sky is the limit,Stop lunchin around, get up and go get it,Cause I came a long way from the past till today,Now I'm never slowin down, ah-ah, no way!,I came to rock and shock and give my all, which is a lot,And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm takin it to the top

1987,Will Smith,"have you ever in your life experienced a day,where nothing at all seems to go your way,no matter how hard you try to get out of the rut,you just could not break the string of bad luck,a day where Murphy's law takes over your life,and you just can't seem to do a darn thing right,and when the day was over you just had to say,you said man it's just one of those days,my day started off kind of cool,I brushed my teeth I comed my hair and I got dressed and went to school,I stopped at the store for a breakfast snack,a tasty cake and orange juice and a bubble yum pack,about that point I proceeded to class,I spoke to all the pretty girls that I passed,I went to my room which was on the first floor,I had no idea what I was in for,I sat in my desk and minded my own business,someone knocked on the door the teacher said who is it,this girl walked in my imigination ran wild,she stole my heart just by the way that she smiled,I couldn't resist so I grabbed her butt,she said what's wrong with you fool are you some kind of nut,the teacher turned around while my arm was extended,she looked me in the face and said Prince you're suspended,I said your tripping it's just a bad habit,she put it in my face she must've wanted me to grab it,I pleaded my case but she wrote the pink slip,then I just shoke my head I said I don't beleive this,she sent me to the head of the discipline staff,I tried to play it off so I started to laugh,I said ha ha this story is great,it's a big misunderstanding one big mistake,he didn't think that it was funny he didn't even smile,he said mmm mmm mmm you're an unlucky child,I stopped laughing and I said why is that,he said just get out my school and don't you ever come back,I said wait this is my school and you're telling me to leave it,he handed me my books and said yep you'd best believe it,as I walked out the school back at the wall I did gaze,and said man it's just one of those days,I woke up around a quarter to eight,I wiped the sleep from out my eyes and I was feeling great,I flipped my radio on and to my utter surprise,I thought that it was eight o'clock but it was half past nine,I hopped up and put my feet on the floor,ran to the bathroom then I  hit my foot on the door,the pain was immense as it started to throb,I said to hell with broken toes I was losing my job,so I combed my hair then I brushed my teeth,threw on my Fila suit and my Fila sneaks,threw on my Fila underwear and my Fila hat,then I ran downstairs and kicked the fila cat,I grabbed my jacket then I grabbed my keys,then I prayed out loud car start please,the car started but what good was that,I couldn't drive it anyway because the tires were flat,I did the hundred yard dash to the top of my block,then I grabbed a dollar bill from my left sweat sock,the bus pulled up I was late and kind of nervous,I got real mad because the sign said out of service,I started hiking it I wasn't liking it,I saw a little kid I stole his bike and started biking it,I thought I got away but when I ducked around the corner,there was twelve cop cars I said I'm a goner,slamed on the flat I did 180 turn,peddled the bike so fast I heard the rubble burn,with the cops in hot pursuit I started feeling like a jerk,I thought man all of this cause I was trying to get to work,I could've got away I almost had 'em shook,til this girl walked by something said not to look,but I thought what the heck a little peek can't hurt,but she made me miss the sign that said men at work,I screamed out loud as I crashed through the baracade,I saw my whole life flash before my face,I felt kind of dizzy all I saw was stars,I put my hands over my eyes and settled on the handle bars,that was stupid I got off track,cause about that point everything went black,the next thing I remember is a head ache nagging,I woke up face down in the back of a paddy wagon,I pinched myself to make sure I wasn't dead,a big Flinstone lump on the side of my head,they took my picture and my finger prints,I said wait you can't arrest me I'm the Fresh Prince,I demand that you release me you incompetent fool,you can't arrest me I'm the Prince you know the rules,you got five seconds 'fore I punch out your lights,but then the cop pulled out his gun I said ha ha psyche,I had a call so I called my boss,I figured I might as well what else could be lost,boss I'm sorry that I couldn't make it today,he said what are you talking about you're off today is Saturday,stuck in a cell scared as hell,I'm a hungry kind of tired and I hate this awful smell,maybe one day I'll get smart and change my ways,but for now it's just one of those days,it's just one of those days

L.,Charlie Mack is up front as we depart the hotel,First we cause chaos throughout the city streets,Then maybe stop at Burger King for a bite to eat,And if somebody gets stupid while we're in the place,Charlie cancels his order and bites off their face,He's not a trouble maker,In fact he's a trouble breaker,And if somebody gets dumb,Well it'll only take a second or two after some fool snaps,Law and order is restored by my hero Charlie Mack,Pull up into the limo and head for the jam,Charlie cracks  all the knuckles on both of his hands,And when we pull into the show the routine is unrehearsed,Just natural to let Charlie hop out first,He clears the crowd without saying a word man,That's the loudest silence I've ever heard,A lot of times guys test him by trying to bug,He just leaves ring imprints all over their mug,He's a Terminator,A Hercules of sorts,Man hell with chess he likes physical sports,You may not have known before but now you know,Why Charlie Mack is the first out the limo,So damn tough,So damn tough,So damn tough,So damn tough,So damn tough,So damn tough,We'd like to appologise to all of our fans but,Please don't touch us while we're at our jams,Cause Charlie don't like folks around us when we're doing a show,And if he punches you uh oh,Better get Maaco,So to all you weak rappers whose tempers are hot,Just because I got something that you ain't got,If you want to get physical rowdy and try to palm me,I won't get excited I'll just say ""Yo Charlie!"",You should have been calm, you shouldn't have snapped,Charlie only hits you once and now you're taking a nap,And when he leaves you decapitated, crushed into dust,You'll look up and see your girl in the limo with us,You may think that's enough home boy, but I think not,""Charlie kick his face again, I think you missed a spot"",I rolled down the limo window and yelled ""Bon Voyage!"",You see your girl buck naked giving Charlie a massage,I'm serious,I'm not joking, no doubt,You know how many doubter's bones have been broken?,You may not have known before but now you know,Why Charlie Mack is the first out the window.,Charlie Mack,The first out the limo,He's Charlie Mack,The first out the limo,In closing we'd like to say this to you, busted,If you're skeptical you'll probably get beat up plus get,Embarrassed and get laughed at by all your friends,And if you cross Charlie Mack you'll suffer the beginning of the end of,Life as you know it,You might not die sir,But if you're not dead you wish you were,But if you still want to bug out homeboy let's go,You can bug with Charlie Mack cause he's the first out the limo,So damn tough,He's Charlie Mack,And he's the first out the limo,So damn,So damn tough,So damn tough,So damn tough,So damn tough
