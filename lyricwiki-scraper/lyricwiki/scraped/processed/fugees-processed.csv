With the force of Elijah,Steppin' to you, they get irrigated like the Niger,So hide the cattle,Fugees come to battle,We'll take all your bounty, then we'll eat your vittles,I'm used to the type of poetics that mesmerize,I caught you checkin' with them Bette Davis eyes!,Surprise, surprise!  You never knew a girl could stylize!,It's from the soul!  I ain't freakin' with white lies,Yo, hey guys!  Remember the summer of '92?,Battle after battle!  Crew after crew!,So, hachoo!  Fugees coming with a brand new style!,I'm rollin' with them hoodies from the H-A-I!,It takes awhile for them average niggas to get it,But once they understand they won't want to freak with this, see...,I'm like the phantom,That's flying like the bird,Doin' shit you never heard,Plus I come from the suburbs,Word to God!,I heard ya had it kinda hard,and you got your skin scarred when they was shootin' on the boulevard!,,""Vocab, baby"" 14x

1994,Fugees,",AhhhhhH!,Check the crippled man, sittin in the church,My conscience hurts, flesh like me hits the dirt,She's paralyzed from her feet to her thighs,And the man who pulled the trigger didn't even lose his necktie,Hi/I check Jimmy cuttin hair at the barbershop,He plays the bass guitar, like David plays the harp,His knowledge name is Greek, cause whenever he speaks,He's got the wisdom of King Solomon bags in his eyes from no sleep,Sometimes he thought of the fame in Madison Square Garden,So some seek stardom, but they forget Harlem,But seeking first of all the kingdom of God is what my pops told me,So if I fall, could the choir catch me,I flew away, on a mountain, got tempted by Satan,Got bitten by a cobra, but the Lord took my venom,So who's side am I on? I'm on the righteous,Always check the lyrics, no time to contradict,Chorus:,Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem ,They/brothers/sisters/families/people/we/brothers,keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty,Well aiyyo family I beseech you, in the hopes that I may reach you,My mother taught me one day that this mid-day would come someday,Born to talk that jive, with peaky hair grown wild,And teachers disliked me, cause I knew where my culture be,So now yeah mom I read history, I can't neglect my passion see,Rock it's kind of new to me, cause my true love was poetry,White was good and bad was black but black was just a massa lackey,built for that B. Nimble Jack and I'd like to save you from the wicked,D-Dog clear I wouldn't be wet,The black to mourn, tomorrow's death,The evil things, glad that I, while angels wrote this violence why?,Help me make me comprehend my black bezerk and why cast it,Time to blaze the angels nappy heads are braided that you make me,see what's hard for me that don't make you flee,when I enter your vicinity, you see my God ain't never after me,So yo I be wised up with Greek,To go and be, the last and good and see what's wrong with me,and through your insecurity of me and my ability,So bredren won't you let me be or has thou asked to much from thy,to tell the truth and not to lie? Oh my...,Chorus 2X,But as I grew, I knew cause the master told me,from a baby to a woman from a woman to a baby,Life is so short, hardcore becomes hard-corpse,Step in a coffin where the money's no longer the source,*singing*,There we go, there we go, there we go,I got mine now won't you get yours, we never open doors,so we neglect, and don't protect the ones that's not,people never really seem to care,And then they cry out, ""My people! Why aren't we treated equal?"",As we flee, we flee our own communities,We leave our family in poverty,And then we blame it on another, so family please recover,Oh c'mon please come now with you can come with me now and blow now,if you want to, we're through...,Chorus 4x
